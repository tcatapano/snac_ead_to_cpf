         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Gilbert Stork was born in Belgium in 1921. His received his
            primary and secondary education in France, before moving to the United States and
            attending the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he earned his Bachelor of
            Science in Chemistry. He went on to do his graduate work in organic chemistry at the
            University of Wisconsin, where he earned his PhD in 1945. </p>
         <p>Stork worked for a year in the pharmaceutical industry before taking a position in the
            Chemistry Department at Harvard. Stork remained at Harvard until 1952 when he accepted a
            position in the Chemistry Department at Columbia University, where he would remain for
            the balance of his career. He became a full professor in 1955, was named the Eugene
            Higgins Professor of Chemistry in 1967, and attained the status of Professor Emeritus in
            1993.</p>
         <p>Professor Stork's work on organic chemistry focused on synthesis, including, notably,
            his achievement of the total synthesis of quinine. He invented a reagent to solve a
            specific problem in total synthesis, is known for including stereospecificity in
            synthetic designs. The Stork enamine synthesis is named in his honor. </p>
         <p>Stork's many awards and honors include the American Chemical Society's Award in Pure
            Chemistry (1957), the American Chemical Society's Award for Creative Work in Synthetic
            Organic Chemistry (1967), the Arthur C. Cope Award (1980), the National Academy of
            Sciences Award in Chemical Sciences (1982), the National Medal of Science (1982), the
            Tetrahedron Prize (1985), the Roger Adams Award (1991), the Wolf Prize (1996), and the
            D.H. Barton Medal, Royal Society of Chemistry (2002).</p>

         <p>The collection contains Stork's office files, arranged chronologically. This
            chronological arrangement reflects Stork's own filing system. While the bulk of the
            material is correspondence between Stork and colleagues, students, and University
            administrators, there are also documents related to conference presentations, symposia,
            and awards, as well as clippings and honors.</p>
