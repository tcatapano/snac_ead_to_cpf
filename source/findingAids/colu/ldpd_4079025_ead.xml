         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Robert J. Levy was born on August 31, 1902, in New Orleans,
            LA. He was raised in New Orleans and attended one year at Tulane University before
            transferring to Harvard University, from which he earned his A.B. degree in English and
            Economics in 1923. In 1927, he married Rebecca Claire Shwartz (b. 1902), also of New
            Orleans, with whom he had one daughter, Ann Patricia Levy. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->A resident of New York City from 1935, Levy traveled often to
            Washington D.C. as a business analyst and financial expert, serving as Head
            Administrative Officer and Business Head C.A.F. for the Office of the Board of Economic
            Welfare and Office of Price Administration Industrial Manufacturing Division
            (January-July 1943) and Head Administrative Officer of the Board of Economic Warfare
            (rubber development and procurement). Levy also served as a Senior Partner in his
            family's financial firm starting in 1932, a position which he retained while overseas
            during World War II, until 1951. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Levy traveled throughout Europe as an officer with the U.S.
            Army, and in 1944 and 1945 served as Liaison Officer from General Dwight David
            Eisenhower to General Charles de Gaulle and Liaison Officer to General Alphonse Juin,
            Chief of Staff for National Defense (France) for the Supreme Headquarters American
            Expeditionary Forces (S.H.A.E.F.) Mission to France. Levy also represented S.H.A.E.F. as
            member secretariat of the four party committee (United States, France, United Kingdom,
            and S.H.A.E.F.). For his service, Levy was awarded a E.A.M.E. Theater Ribbon with 1
            star, World War II Victory Medal, and Croix de Guerre with Palm (France) and received
            the French Legion of Honor (Chevalier) and Order of the British Empire (Degree Officer).</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>Much of the collection is drawn from scrapbooks kept by Lt. Col. Robert J. Levy during
            his period of military service in the U.S. Army. Consisting primarily of administrative
            and personal documentation, Levy's papers focus mainly on his time as Liaison Officer
            from General Dwight David Eisenhower to General Charles de Gaulle (1944-1945). The
            collection also contains ephemera and personal mementos from this time, as well as
            related correspondence both during and after Levy's service, including a brief
            correspondence with Eisenhower (1968) regarding Eisenhower's position on the war in
            Vietnam. </p>
         <p>The strength of the papers lies in their documentation of events of World War II from
            the perspective of someone positioned close to the major historical players. Included in
            the collection are not only restricted communiques between de Gaulle and the Allies, but
            also opinions about de Gaulle himself and the effect of the war on the mood and cultural
            attitudes of the French people, notably an increase in anti-Semitic feeling. The
            collection also provides a snapshot of daily events through rosters, correspondence, and
            daily orders. The collection also contains manuscript drafts and notes detailing Levy's
            experiences with and perspectives on de Gaulle. </p>
         <p>The material type of the collection is mixed. Many items in the collection were once or
            are still mounted to scrapbook pages.</p>

         <p>This collection has been left in its original physical order, but is intellectually
            arranged in three series. Although a broad distinction has been made between documents
            related to general military operations and those related to Levy personally, most of
            Levy's personal papers also reflect on or relate to his time in the military. <list type="simple">
