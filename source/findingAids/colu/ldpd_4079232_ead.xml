         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ted Berrigan, born Edmund Joseph Michael Berrigan, Jr. in
            Providence, Rhode Island, in 1934, was a member of the second generation of the New York
            School of Poets. After a year at Providence College, Berrigan enlisted in the army. He
            served in Korea, and, upon his return, enrolled at the University of Tulsa where he
            received his bachelor's degree in English in 1959 and his master's in 1962. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Considering himself a late Beat poet, Berrigan drew
            inspiration from American Expressionism. He also embraced the Beat lifestyle,
            hitchhiking across the United States and experimenting with drugs. His work is most
            often compared to that of Frank O'Hara, a poet whom he greatly admired and mentioned in
            his earlier journals. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1962, Berrigan met and married Sandra Alpers who was eight
            years his junior and considered a minor in her home state of Florida. Sandy, as he
            called her, spent the first two months of their marriage in a mental institution in
            Miami where her parents had her committed because of the marriage. The two went on to
            have two children, David and Kate, before separating in 1965, due in large part to
            Berrigan's infidelities. In 1972 he married poet Alice Notley, and they had two sons,
            Anselm and Edmund. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Berrigan published his most significant work, <title render="italic">The Sonnets,</title> in 1964. That same year he, along with Ron
            Padgett and Joe Brainard, founded <title render="italic">C: A Journal of Poetry.</title>
            Berrigan also met with success in the classroom, gaining student followings at the
            various schools where he taught courses in poetry. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Berrigan was in poor health and essentially homebound his
            final few years after decades of drug use and diet pill abuse. Ted Berrigan died in July
            1983 at the age of 48.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Ted Berrigan collection is divided into two distinct series. The first consists of
            letters from him to his first wife Sandy during her time in a mental institution in
            Miami in 1962. Her parents had her committed and had Ted run out of town after learning
            of their marriage. Most of these letters are typed, but a few are handwritten. Berrigan
            includes drawings, photographs, and a few newspaper/magazine clippings. The letters
            describe his work and travels during the two months they are apart as well as his
            efforts to convince her parents to change their minds. Most of the letters are dated,
            and there are several envelopes with postmarks.</p>
         <p>The second part of the collection consists of thirteen of Berrigan's journals dating
            from January 1961 to March 1975. The journals include both professional and personal
            aspects of Berrigan's life. He writes of relationships, including his tumultuous
            marriage to Sandy and his second marriage to Alice Notley. He writes of the influence of
            other poets and artists, specifically Frank O'Hara and Andy Warhol, both of whom he met.
            Many of the entries include his poetry and lists of his daily activities. Also included
            are numerous lists of poems/poets, books, and films of interest to Berrigan. There are
            many photographs, newspaper/magazine clippings, letters, and drawings (several of which
            are by Joe Brainard) affixed to the pages of the journals. Friends Dick Gallup, Ron
            Padgett, Joe Brainard, and Robert Creeley are mentioned frequently. In several of the
            later volumes, he begins writing from both sides of the journal, leaving several of the
            middle pages blank.</p>
