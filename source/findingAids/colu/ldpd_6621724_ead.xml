            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, founded in
                1768 by twenty New York City merchants, was one of the first commercial
                organizations of its kind in the country. Formed around the premise of serving the
                needs of the local business community, the Chamber eventually became one of the
                industry's strongest advocates. Over the years, its activities attracted the
                participation of a number of New York's most renowned business leaders, including
                former New York City Mayor and the Chamber's first president, John Cruger, Samuel
                F.B. Morse, John Jacob Astor, Peter Cooper, J. Pierpont Morgan, and multiple members
                of the Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, and Murray families; notable figures such as Thomas
                Edison, Andrew Mellon, and Herbert Hoover were elected to honorary membership. The
                Chamber aimed to unify the voice of commercial industry in New York, allowing a
                respected forum for dialogue among its members which would often result in an
                amalgamated effort towards action and resolution. The prominence and power of its
                members garnered distinction for the organization, placing the Chamber in a unique
                position to command the attention of government bodies both locally and nationally.
                Collectively, the organization was able to agitate for legislation that would
                provide a favorable climate for the growth of business in New York City and State,
                in turn encouraging the development of a complex urban environment in which
                commercial industry could thrive. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Chamber's founding members first met on April 5, 1768
                at Bolton and Sigel's Tavern, now known as Fraunces Tavern, to form a mercantile
                union that would defend and promote their collective interests. Organized under the
                name the New York Chamber of Commerce, the society moved its home base to the Royal
                Exchange in 1770, and was granted a royal charter from King George III incorporating
                it as “the Corporation of the Chamber of Commerce in the City of New York in
                America." </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the
                membership was divided into Loyalist and Patriot factions. Patriot members,
                including John Cruger, the first President of the Chamber, left New York City after
                the British invasion of 1776 while their Loyalist counterparts continued to hold
                meetings and transact business in the City. After the British evacuation in 1783,
                the Chamber's returning Patriot members quickly established control over the
                organization and relocated to the Merchants' Coffee House building. The Chamber was
                issued a new charter in 1784 reincorporating it as "the Corporation of the Chamber
                of Commerce of the State of New York." In 1793, the Chamber again relocated; this
                time to the Tontine Association across the street from the Merchants' Coffee House.
                Member participation began dropping steadily after the turn of the century, and by
                1806 meetings were suspended due to lack of attendance. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1817, Chamber President Cornelius Ray called for
                resumption of the organization's business. New officers were elected and the
                membership base was increased by thirty-six during the first meeting. This marked
                the beginning of a new era for the organization. As of 1827, the Chamber had claimed
                the Merchants Exchange Building as its headquarters; however, the Great Fire of New
                York in 1835 forced members to relocate once more, this time to the Merchants Bank
                on Wall Street. Though many of the Chamber's prized historical objects and documents
                were saved from the fire, including member portraits, minute books, and the
                Chamber's official seal, the original charter is believed to have perished. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->By 1849, membership had surpassed the two hundred mark, and
                the administration became increasingly consumed by management concerns. Elected
                officers authorized the hiring of an official clerk and librarian to assist the
                elected Secretary in overseeing day-to-day functions. The administrative staff was
                vital to the operation of the Chamber, answering outside inquiries on the
                organization's work and fielding appeals for guidance and counsel from commercial
                organizations across the country, all the while facilitating dialogue among the
                Chamber's constituency and countless committees. The outreach efforts of the
                administration, in addition to the prestigious projects the organization was
                involved in, quickly established the Chamber as a model for other chambers of
                commerce, both domestically and abroad. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->As its membership increased in size and prestige during the
                1800s, the Chamber's power grew accordingly and the organization proved to be
                instrumental in the realization of several initiatives integral to the development
                of both New York City and State. In the interest of serving regional commerce, the
                Chamber heavily promoted the construction of the Erie Canal in the early 1800s and
                the establishment of the first transatlantic cable in 1858. The Chamber became
                progressively more involved in trade and commercial concerns at the national and
                international levels, and began releasing annual reports in the mid-1800s which
                outlined the condition of mercantile affairs and noted important changes relative to
                trade in the national business market. Perhaps one of its most recognized
                contributions to the business industry was its role in arbitrating commercial
                disputes among regional merchants. The Chamber's creation of a Court of Arbitration,
                a body recognized by the State to oversee commercial disputes, and its own Committee
                on Arbitration, whose records and purpose often overlap with the Court's, are both
                indications of the Chamber's commitment to settling mercantile disagreements and
                furthering its goal of providing merchants with an agreeable environment in which to
                conduct business. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Chamber also lent its support to major public works
                within New York City--the expansion of the City's water and waste management system,
                construction of a rapid transit system, and quality commercial education for area
                businessmen were all projects championed by the Chamber. The defense and management
                of New York ports and harbors were also of concern; the eruption of the Civil War in
                the United States prompted the Chamber to gather funds and successfully petition
                both the Executive and Legislative branches of the United States, the New York State
                Legislature, and the New York City Council for an allocation of money for the
                defense of the New York Harbor. In addition to these large scale ventures, the
                organization was involved in numerous smaller projects over the years, including
                construction of a lighthouse in Martinique, overseeing the Nautical School of the
                Port of New York, and developing measures to protect the City's population during
                cholera outbreaks in the 1890s. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Many of these accomplishments can be attributed to the work
                of the Chamber's standing committees which began to appear in great numbers by the
                second half of the 19th century. Committees were an essential component of the
                organization; they allowed members to focus on a broad range of issues relevant to
                commercial industry in the New York region and nationwide. Standing committees often
                concentrated on a general sector of commerce such as finance, conservation, public
                service, or taxation laws, while ad hoc special and sub-committees focused on these
                topics in finer detail. The proliferation of committees at various points in the
                Chamber's history can be directly linked to contemporary affairs; certainly, the
                occurrence of particular events throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, such as
                debates on the National Budget, natural disasters, or urban entertainments, can
                often be traced by the existence of corresponding Chamber committees. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->At the turn of the 20th century, the Chamber's
                administration grew again as it faced a progressively more complex business
                environment; the administration now included the elected positions of Executive Vice
                President, Assistant Secretary, and Assistant Treasurer. The result of the Chamber's
                growing influence and prosperity was the 1902 completion of construction of the
                Chamber of Commerce building at 65 Liberty Street in lower Manhattan. Illustrating
                the Chamber's importance at the national level, both President Theodore Roosevelt
                and former President Grover Cleveland spoke at the building's dedication. The top
                floor of the new building, the Grand Hall, was lined with the Chamber's collection
                of over 200 member portraits and it was here that most business was transacted,
                including regularly occurring member meetings. The Chamber's wealth and prestige
                continued to swell exponentially, and in honor of the Chamber's significant projects
                and influential membership, increasingly opulent annual banquets were held.
                Invitations were delivered by messenger and hand engraved by Tiffany and Company,
                whose founder was also a member. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Following this period of economic and civic prosperity
                leading up to the 1920s, the Chamber began a gentle descent, slowly losing members
                and influence. The Chamber began considering the possibility of merging with other
                New York City commercial organizations as early as the 1940s. An agreement was
                reached in 1973 between the Chamber and the Commerce and Industry Association,
                formerly the Merchants' Association, to merge the two parties into one organization:
                The New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry. However, this new incarnation of the
                Chamber did little to alleviate the organization's declining revenue and dwindling
                authority. In 1979 the Chamber left its headquarters at 65 Liberty Street and moved
                in with the New York City Partnership, an affiliate organization founded by Chamber
                member, David Rockefeller. In 2002 the two organizations formally merged to form the
                Partnership for New York City and the Chamber ceased to exist.</p>

            <p>The archival records of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide a
                thorough history of the organization, rendering a vivid portrait of the Chamber by
                means of committee records, minute books, printed materials, photographs, reports,
                and a wealth of correspondence. Materials originate mostly from the 19th and 20th
                centuries, though there are some notable items from the 18th century such as the
                first volume of Chamber of Commerce meeting minutes that dates back to 1768. Subject
                matter in the collection primarily focuses on New York City and State commercial and
                urban development, though it often extends to national and global business concerns.
                This collection is particularly notable because of the presence of the records of
                the Commerce and Industry Association, formerly the Merchants' Association, a
                commercial institution whose focus and constituency were comparable to that of the
                Chamber. The Chamber of Commerce merged with the Commerce and Industry Association
                in 1973 and thereby acquired the Association's historical records. Series IV is
                devoted solely to the records of the Commerce and Industry Association while the

                <scopecontent><p>The first series of the collection offers materials that reflect the
                        administrative tasks of the organization. Because the subject matter is
                        broad in scope, the series has been divided into small sections with each
                        section heading arranged alphabetically. Records related to financial
                        matters, the construction of the Chamber of Commerce building in lower
                        Manhattan, and public relations materials such as press releases and printed
                        distribution materials can be found in this series. Also present are the
                        records of the Board of Trustees of the Real Estate, a designated group of
                        Chamber members who dealt primarily with the property holdings of the
                        Chamber; various affiliate organizations who shared membership with the
                        Chamber and often maintained offices in the Chamber of Commerce building;
                        and of particular significance, documents that detail the Chamber's eventual
                        merger with the Commerce and Industry Association in 1973. Items related to
                        the events hosted by the Chamber are especially rich—records of the
                        Chamber's annual banquets, New York public school essay contests, and
                        various luncheons and receptions honoring prestigious figures can be found
                        here. This series also offers a few items of realia, notably several medals
                        created especially for the Chamber of Commerce to commemorate specific
                        accomplishments.</p>

                        business in the New York region, providing both national and local
                        commercial statistics, yearly accounts of the industry, and special reports
                        on New York trade, commerce, and finance. They also document the activities
                        of the Chamber itself by highlighting noteworthy accomplishments and events
                        of the past year through a compilation of speeches, reports, and narrative
                        summaries. Series II offers a complete run of the Chamber's annual reports
                        from 1858 to 1926; subsequently, only the years 1966-1975 are present.</p>

                <scopecontent><p> The monthly bulletins of the Chamber of Commerce, which make up the third
                        series of the collection, capture a distinctive picture of the Chamber's
                        purpose and actions. This series contains a comprehensive set of bulletins
                        from 1909 to 1963, as well as a few supplemental materials from the 1950s to
                        1970s. Each bulletin contains information on news and activities of the
                        Chamber, meeting minutes, reports, and library additions. Their initial
                        audience was the organization's members, though they were later printed by
                        the thousands and distributed monthly to libraries, business organizations,
                        public officials and students of economics both domestically and abroad.
                        Eventually, the Chamber began binding bulletins in yearly editions, and
                        members received a personalized copy. While each individual monthly bulletin
                        contains a table of contents, the bound volumes are also indexed for ease of
                        use. </p>

                <scopecontent><p> The fourth series in the collection is arguably the most complex. It is
                        comprised of the records of the Commerce and Industry Association, an
                        organization similar to the Chamber of Commerce in purpose, which eventually
                        merged with the Chamber in 1973 following a decline in both organizations'
                        membership and corresponding influence. Researchers should note that these
                        records date back to 1873; therefore documents from the Merchants'
                        Association, an earlier incarnation of the Commerce and Industry
                        Association, are included. This series is divided into six subseries
                        according to format or purpose; because of this, each individual subseries
                        closely mirrors the series in the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry
                        collection as a whole. </p>

                            of the Commerce and Industry Association. Though relatively small, the
                            subject matter is broad in scope, including a small selection of annual
                            reports, public relations materials, and information on the merger with
                            the New York Chamber of Commerce. Of particular interest in this series
                            are the printed transcripts from the Association's Business Forum Radio
                            broadcasts which ran for several years in the 1940s and billed itself as
                            a "public service program." Additionally, materials related to the
                            Association's merger with the Chamber of Commerce can be found here.

                            committees to examine current issues relevant to local and national
                            business and industry. This subseries contains the records of several of
                            these committees in existence throughout the 20th century. Committee
                            records are mostly made up of meeting minutes and correspondence;
                            subjects addressed include city laws and regulations, finance, foreign
                            trade, immigration, taxes, and transportation. </p>

                            correspondence files deriving mostly from the early to mid-20th century.
                            The bulk of materials originates from or is addressed to the
                            Association's administrative branch, particularly the Secretary and
                            Executive Vice President, as well as committee and department heads.
                            Discussion on a wide range of topics can be found here, with an emphasis
                            on New York City and State development and administration.
                            Correspondence is arranged alphabetically according to subject and
                            retains its original order. </p>

                            meetings at various levels in the organization, with an almost complete
                            run of minutes from the meetings of the Board of Directors and the
                            Executive Committee. Minutes generally include committee reports,
                            information on member elections, and discussion of Association
                            activities. Similar in function to those of the Chamber of Commerce,
                            these member and administrative meetings were a vehicle to address
                            matters affecting local and national commerce, and reach consensus among
                            members. Minutes are both bound and loose, and organized
                            chronologically. </p>

                <scopecontent><p>The Committee on Arbitration was a significant body of the Chamber of
                        Commerce, although its importance varied greatly throughout the Chamber's
                        existence. Because the Committee retained such a large portion of its
                        records, it was designated as its own series, Series V, apart from the
                        Subseries VI.2: General Committees. Established during the formative years
                        of the Chamber, the Committee on Arbitration was appointed to hear and rule
                        on disputes on mercantile and marine matters. The Committee on Arbitration
                        was instrumental in securing legislation to create a Court of Arbitration,
                        and was widely recognized for its role in developing arbitration systems in
                        commercial and civic associations nationwide. Series V is divided into three
                        subseries according to the original order of the material.</p>

                    <scopecontent><p> The bulk of the series is found in Subseries 1 which consists of
                            arbitration case records submitted to the Chamber’s Committee on
                            Arbitration. The Committee on Arbitration did not keep original
                            documents for early arbitration cases; instead they recorded the name of
                            the disputants, a brief description of the case, and the names and
                            decision of the arbitrators’ in their Committee minute books. Although
                            this collection does not contain the original copies of the Committee
                            minute books from that time period, the cases were compiled into a
                            publication entitled, <title altrender="italic">Earliest Arbitration Records of the Chamber of
                                Commerce of the State of New York, Committee Minutes, 1779-1792</title>, which
                            can be found in the holdings of Columbia University Libraries. The
                            Committee on Arbitration began keeping original materials in the 1820s
                            and while case records are inconsistent, most files found here contain
                            correspondence and/or official arbitration documents. Following the
                            renewal of the Committee on Arbitration in 1912, case records are more
                            comprehensive and standardized; they often include the stenographer’s
                            minutes of the proceedings and, in some instances, evidence. </p>

                            case was retained by the Committee on Arbitration and can be found in
                            Subseries 2. These files consist of parties seeking information
                            concerning their case, as well as advice on arbitration processes. Some
                            disputes were resolved without the need for formal arbitration.
                            Materials found in this subseries date largely between 1922 and 1927,
                            and are arranged by case number in accordance with the filing system
                            used during the tenure of Committee Chairman Charles Bernheimer. </p>

                    <scopecontent><p> Subseries 3 is devoted to the records of the Chairman of the Committee
                            on Arbitration. Correspondence files make up the bulk of the subseries
                            and mostly derive from Committee Chairman Charles Bernheimer's tenure
                            from 1912-1944. Both the correspondence files and the Chairman's
                            administrative files, which make up the remainder of the subseries,
                            illustrate Bernheimer's role in promoting arbitration at the local,
                            national, and international levels. Materials in this subseries are
                            arranged alphabetically by subject. </p>

                        membership. Committee records contain correspondence, reports, and meeting

                    <scopecontent><p> The purpose of most of the administrative committees of the Chamber of
                            Commerce was to oversee routine functions such as lunch service,
                            committee nominations, and Chamber membership. This subseries contains
                            materials that document those functions; however, a large portion of the
                            subseries is devoted to the administrative records and meeting minutes
                            of the Executive Committee. Perhaps the most significant of the
                            administrative committees, the Executive Committee acted as the
                            managerial body of the Chamber. It received all general committee
                            reports prior to their submission to the Chamber’s membership; as a
                            result, the Executive Committee meeting minutes found in this subseries
                            often contain these reports as well as a record of suggested actions and

                    <scopecontent><p> The second subseries is comprised of the Chamber’s general, or standing,
                            committees. Numerous and widely varied, these committees were formed to
                            provide a through examination of subjects of interest to the Chamber.
                            Joint, special, or sub-committees were often formed to address specific
                            topics in more depth and detail. Committees represented in this
                            subseries address subjects such as commercial education, finance and
                            currency, shipping, trade, transportation, and urban development.
                            Records of each committee are inconsistent; however, files often contain
                            correspondence, meeting minutes, and reports. It should be noted that,
                            prior to the late 19th century, all general committees were referred to
                            by a uniform title: the Committee of the Chamber of Commerce. Records of
                            these early committees can be found at the beginning of the subseries;
                            the remaining committees are alphabetized by subject. </p>

                        the Chamber’s officers, the correspondence in the third subseries is a group
                        of subject files that were compiled by the organization in the second half
                        of the 20th century. </p>

                    <scopecontent><p> The majority of records found in Subseries 1 originate from the
                            correspondence of the Chamber's Secretaries, who were responsible for
                            handling most of the communication for the Chamber's President and Vice
                            Presidents, as well as the organization as a whole. Missives directed to
                            the Chamber were generally funneled through the Secretary before
                            reaching those in higher offices. This subseries reflects the tenure of
                            several of the Chamber's Secretaries throughout the late 19th century
                            and 20th century. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically according to
                            the Secretary's last name, and then by subject. Beginning in the early
                            20th century, records often contain copies of outgoing as well as
                            incoming correspondence. </p>

                    <scopecontent><p> Perhaps one of the Chamber’s most dedicated staff members, Charles
                            Gwynne was first employed by the organization as a clerk in 1894.
                            Advancing through the ranks, Gwynne was elected Assistant Secretary,
                            1909-1915; Secretary, 1915-1924; Vice-President 1922-1924; and Executive
                            Vice-President, 1924-1944. Subseries 2 contains Charles Gwynne’s
                            correspondence with national and international businesses and chambers
                            of commerce, and the Chamber's committees and members; it mostly derives
                            from Gwynne's time as Secretary. Like the materials found in Subseries
                            1, the items found here are a part of the administration's
                            correspondence; however, because Gwynne retained such a large volume of
                            his correspondence, his materials were given a separate subseries. Due
                            to Gwynne's prolific correspondence it appears that documents were
                            occasionally misfiled; therefore, it may be useful to view folders on
                            similar subjects. </p>

                <scopecontent><p> The correspondence subject files in subseries 3 remains true to its original
                        order, though researchers should note that the original arrangement appears
                        to have been contrived by the organization itself in the second half of the
                        20th century. The correspondence found here focuses on a wide range of
                        topics, and derives largely from the 19th century. Subjects of local
                        concern, such as urban development, New York City harbor defense, and
                        sanitation are noted. National issues related to commerce and industry also
                        figure into the correspondence in this subseries; the Chamber's involvement
                        with the establishment of the first transatlantic cable, international
                        canals as a means of transport, national currency, interstate commerce, and
                        government offices are all subjects addressed here. Correspondence is
                        arranged alphabetically by subject. </p>

                <scopecontent><p> The minutes contained in this series, which date back to the Chamber's
                        founding in 1768, offer an intimate look at the key functions of the
                        organization and its involvement in New York City and State business and
                        development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. These meetings centered
                        on issues that were of significance to local and national commerce,
                        pinpointing how current events would affect business practices. Members used
                        these gatherings as a time to draw attention to their concerns and establish
                        a collective position among the Chamber constituency. Prominent guests were
                        a regular part of each meeting and included state and local politicians,
                        foreign dignitaries, and national luminaries--Herbert Hoover, John D.
                        Rockefeller III, and Frank Lloyd Wright are among several of the iconic
                        figures invited to address the Chamber's monthly meetings over the years.
                        Minutes run continuously from 1768 to 1933 and are documented in oversize
                        bound volumes. Subsequent years are inconsistently represented and are
                        recorded as typescript; minutes from the 1940s are lacking entirely.
                        Administrative documentation and candid photographs for several 20th century
                        guest speakers can be found respectively in Series I: Administration and
                        Series X: Photographs. </p>

                <scopecontent><p> The printed materials of Series IX encompass a diverse assortment of small
                        pamphlets, leaflets, and booklets intended primarily for limited circulation
                        among a targeted audience. Committee reports, tributes to members, and
                        annual compilations of national chambers of commerce are examples of some of
                        the items found here. A significant portion of Series IX is devoted to a
                        selection of pamphlet publications which have been bound in volumes
                        according to date of issuance. Each volume contains pamphlets on an
                        assortment of topics such as currency, commercial law, defense, and
                        quarantine laws; fold out maps often serve as illustration. Printed
                        materials are organized according to their subject matter or title. For the
                        Chamber of Commerce's more formal publications that were intended for wider
                        distribution, researchers should consult the New York Chamber of Commerce
                        and Industry Publications collection. </p>

                <scopecontent><p> The final series in this collection is comprised largely of photographic
                        prints, though a few photographic slides and glass plate slides are present.
                        A significant portion of these items lack any identifying information and
                        several are undated. Photographs are arranged alphabetically according to
                        subject; a few are oversized. Of particular note are photographs from the
                        Chamber's annual banquet, candid shots of guest speakers at the
                        organization's monthly meetings, and portraits of Chamber members throughout
                        the years. </p>
