         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Harriet Korn Lehman was the daughter of Isidore S. Korn, a
            real estate magnate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She attended
            the Lincoln School of Columbia University's Teachers College, graduating in 1927. She
            married one of the sons of Emmanuel Lehman. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Korn and Lehman families were politically and socially
            connected to one another throughout much of the 20th century. Isidore Korn was an
            associate of Philip Lehman, son of Emanuel Lehman (uncle of Herbert Lehman, who would
            later become the governor of New York), as they served on the board of several Jewish
            charitable organizations in the early 20th century, such as the Hebrew Orphan's Asylum.
            Another member of the Korn family later married the widow of Herbert's son Peter after
            Peter's death in WWII.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>About half of the collection is material related to Harriet Korn Lehman. This small
            amount of material relates to her time at the Lincoln School, an experimental school
            founded in the early 20th century by Progressive education theorists at Columbia
            University's Teacher's College. These include her graduation excercises as she finished
            Elementary school, as well as a collection of writings by Lincoln School elementary
            students. Also with the material in the year book is a high school literary journal, and
            the high school year book from the 1926 Lincoln School class.</p>
         <p>Also included in the
            collection is a scrap book and a common-place book from the 1870s belonging to Isidore
            S. Korn, presumably the father of Harriet Korn Lehman. The scrap book consists mostly of
            cartoons, poems, and advice columns (such as he daily or weekly written by Henry Ward
            Beecher) clipped from newspapers and pasted into an old account book. The Common Place
            book is a collection of noteworthy quotes or selections from plays, poems, novels, and
            non-fiction works, hand-copied by the young Isidore. At the end of the common place book
            are two award winning essays Isidore wrote during his years at Columbia, one on the
            origins of the Roman Republic and another on the Philosophy of History.</p>
