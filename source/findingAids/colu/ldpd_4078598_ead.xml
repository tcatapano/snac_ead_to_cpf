         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lydia Maria Child was born Lydia Maria Francis in Medford,
            Massachusetts in February, 1802. Francis was born into an abolitionist family and was
            greatly influenced by her brother, Convers, who would later become a Unitarian
            Clergyman. After the death of her mother in 1814, Child moved to Maine to live with her
            sister and began teaching in Gardiner in 1819. While living in Maine, Child became
            increasingly interested in Native Americans and visited many nearby settlements. Child
            began actively writing shortly after returning to Massachusetts to live with her
            brother. She published her first novel, Hobomok, in 1824, at the age of 22. The story
            depicted the relationship between a girl from New England and a Native American.
            Although the book was published anonymously, Child would later gain fame as the author
            of <title render="italic">Hobomok</title>, the first American historical novel. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Child continued to have a vibrant writing career throughout
            her life; she was the pioneer of many writing forms, such as historical fiction,
            children's literature, and women's literature. In 1826, she founded <title render="italic">Juvenile Miscellany</title>,
            the first children's periodical in the United States; she published <title render="italic">The American Frugal
            Housewife</title> in 1844. Child published her first anti-slavery book in 1833, <title render="italic">An Appeal in
            Favor of That Class of Americans We Call Africans</title>, arguing for full, uncompensated
            emancipation of slavery and full racial equality. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Following her marriage to journalist and fellow abolitionist,
            David Lee Child, in 1828, Child and her husband became acquainted with William Lloyd
            Garrison, who greatly influenced their devotion to abolitionism. With her husband, Child
            established the <title render="italic">National Anti-Slavery Standard</title>, the official weekly newspaper of the
            American Anti-Slavery Society, in 1840. Among her many abolitionist efforts, Child
            transcribed recollections of freed slaves and edited Harriet Jacobs's <title render="italic">Incidents in the
            Life of a Slave Girl</title> (1861). Public reactions to her actions were frequently negative,
            but Child continued with her endeavors against slavery and also supported both women's
            rights and Native American rights throughout her life. Child died in 1880, at age 78, in
            her home in Wayland, Massachusetts.</p>

               <scopecontent><p>This series is comprised of both personal and professional letters written by
                     Child to her peers. Most of the personal correspondences located in folder 1
                     are about planning or recalling recent visits to friends, though there are
                     letters regarding Child's spirituality, the death of her husband, David Lee
                     Child, as well as a letter about her brother and his influence on her writing.
                     The professional letters in folder 2 include many passionate letters written by
                     Child regarding the anti-slavery movement in the United States. Letters to
                     George Curtis, William Lloyd Garrison, and Robert F. Walcott are also located
                     in folder 2. The letters frequently mention the sociopolitical issues
                     surrounding slavery, and the activities of Child and her contemporaries in
                     response to those issues. One letter, from Josiah Quincy, addresses Child's
                     request for the erection of a statue of lawyer and abolitionist Charles Sumner.
                     Additionally, a letter written by Child requesting copies of the "emancipation
                     tract" is located in folder 2. In addition to letters regarding the
                     anti-slavery movement are notes to the editors of the <title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title> and the
                    <title render="italic"> Boston Traveller</title> concerning Child's writings that were submitted for
                     publication.</p>
                  <p> Together with other letters by Child from the Park Benjamin, Sydney Howard
                     Gay, Jay Family, and John H. Payne collections, the letters in folders 1 and 2
                     may also be accessed on microfilm under call number "MS Coll Child."</p>
