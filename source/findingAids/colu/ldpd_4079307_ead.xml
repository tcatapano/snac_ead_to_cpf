         <abstract>A true pioneer in the area of women's rights, Elizabeth Blackwell was the first
            female physician in the United States. This collection primarily consists of her letters
            to close, personal friend Barbara Leigh Smith, later Barbara Bodichon. Also included are
            a few letters to Bodichon from Bessie Parkes, Dr. Emily Blackwell, and Elizabeth
            Whitehead.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell was born in Bristol, England, in 1821
            to a politically outspoken father committed to fairness among his male and female
            children. In 1832, Samuel Blackwell moved his family to the United States in part for
            financial reasons but also to participate in the abolitionist movement. Two of his
            daughters would grow up to continue this fight against slavery and to work towards
            women's rights, specifically in the area of women in medicine. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After years of struggling to be taken seriously and receiving
            rejections from 29 schools, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to receive a
            medical degree in the United States in 1849. Upon graduating first in her class from New
            York's Geneva Medical College, she left for Europe, working in clinics in London and
            Paris. It was during her time in England in 1850 that Blackwell's cousin, Bessie Rayner
            Parkes, introduced her to fellow women's rights pioneer Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon.
            Then, while studying midwifery in France, Blackwell contracted purulent opthalmia,
            costing her sight in one eye and prompting her return to New York in 1851. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Sexism in the United States limited Blackwell's opportunities
            for employment and for much intellectual exchange with other physicians, so, in 1853,
            Blackwell opened her own small dispensary. Then in 1857, along with her sister Emily,
            also a doctor, and their friend Dr. Marie Zakrzewska, she founded the New York Infirmary
            for Women and Children. At the onset of the Civil War, Blackwell organized the Women's
            Central Association of Relief, training nurses for war service. She and her sister also
            helped to establish the United States Sanitary Commission. After the war, the Blackwell
            sisters founded the Women's Medical College at their infirmary in New York where
            Elizabeth served on the faculty until 1869 when she moved back to London. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Blackwell gave up the practice of medicine in the 1870s due to
            her declining health, but she continued to teach and campaign for increased
            opportunities for women in the medical field. She died in England in 1910 at the age of
            89. In 1949, 100 years after she received her M.D., the American Medical Women's
            Association created the Elizabeth Blackwell Medal to honor outstanding contributions
            made by women in the medical field.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Elizabeth Blackwell Letters are a collection of personal letters to her friend
            Barbara Bodichon. They include details of Blackwell's professional activities, her
            travels, and major events in her life, such as her decision to adopt a child. Many of
            the letters are congratulatory or condolatory of events in Bodichon's life. Also
            included in the collection are letters to Bodichon from three other women - Bessie
            Parkes, Dr. Emily Blackwell, and Elizabeth Whitehead. Parkes was Blackwell's cousin and
            Bodichon's best friend and introduced the two during Blackwell's study in England in
            1850. Emily Blackwell was Elizabeth's younger sister and is mentioned in some of
            Elizabeth's letters to Bodichon. The four letters from Whitehead are signed simply
            "Elizabeth;" however, it was determined in 1964 by Elinor Rice Hays, a Blackwell family
            biographer, that they had not been written by Blackwell. They were therefore attributed
            to Whitehead based on Hester Burton's biography of Bodichon. A note is attached to each
            of the four letters. </p>
         <p>A few of the letters in this collection mention Florence Nightingale, Bodichon's cousin. </p>
         <p>Included at the beginning of this collection is a "Contents" folder, which provides a
            brief synopsis of each letter contained in the collection. It appears dates were
            attributed to many of the letters after this folder had been created. Therefore, the
            order is not truly chronological.</p>
