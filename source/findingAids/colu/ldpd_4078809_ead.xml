         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Allen Ginsberg, born Irwin Allen Ginsberg, grew up in Paterson
            New Jersey with his parents, Louis and Naomi Ginsberg and his brother Eugene Brooks.
            Both of Allen's parents were to be major influences on him and his work-- his father, a
            poet and high school English teacher, was one of his earliest and most constant readers
            and critics. His mother's mental illness would profoundly affect Ginsberg as well,
            though in a very different way, ultimately inspiring Ginsberg's poem "Kaddish: for Naomi
            Ginsberg 1894-1956." </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ginsberg left Paterson for New York City when he was accepted
            to Columbia University as an undergraduate. He entered University in the Fall of 1943
            and soon met fellow Columbia student, Lucien Carr who would introduce Ginsberg to Jack
            Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. This group of friends would form the nucleus of the
            Beat Generation. Though a brilliant student, Ginsberg was expelled from Columbia in 1945
            for scrawling an obscenity on his window and for engaging in homosexual sex. He did,
            however, return to the University the next year and completed his BA in 1948. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After Ginsberg's graduation he remained in New York City and
            his apartment became a meeting place and crash pad for his group of friends, including
            Herbert Huncke-- a drug addict, petty thief, and Times Square habitue. When the
            apartment was busted containing Huncke's stolen goods, Huncke took the jail time, but
            Ginsberg was still implicated. Rather than go to jail, Ginsberg plead that he was
            psychologically unfit to stand trial and was sent to the Columbia Psychiatric Institute
            for an eight month sentence. It was here that he met Carl Solomon, to whom he would
            dedicate the poem "Howl." </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After he was released from the psychiatric hospital, Ginsberg
            remained in New York for a few years, starting to write and working odd jobs, before he
            moved to San Francisco in 1953. Once he was in San Francisco, he met a group of
            California artists and poets including Philip Whalen, Michael McClure, Philip Lamantia,
            and Lawrence Ferlinghetti and became involved in the San Francisco Renaissance movement
            that was taking place on the west coast literary scene. It was in San Francisco that
            Ginsberg first wrote "Howl" and read it for the first time at the 1955 Six Gallery
            reading hosted by Kenneth Rexroth. It was also in San Francisco that Ginsberg met Peter
            Orlovsky who would be his lover, collaborator, and companion throughout the rest of his
            life. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ginsberg spent the next few years nominally based in New York
            City, but traveling widely. He visited William Burroughs in Tangier, Morocco and
            famously lived in Paris at "The Beat Hotel" at 9 Rue Git-le-coeur with Gregory Corso and
            Willaim Burroughs where he helped assemble Burroughs's <title render="italic">The Naked
               Lunch</title> manuscript. He and Peter Orlovsky spent the greater part of 1962-1963
            in India. This experience would be the basis for his non-fiction book <title render="italic">Indian Journals.</title> He moved back to New York, living in both
            the city and a farm house in Cherry Valley in upstate New York where he based his
            non-profit artists' relief fund, The Committee on Poetry. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1974 Ginsberg helped to found the Jack Kerouac School of
            Disembodied Poetics of the Naropa Institute where he was also a member of the faculty.
            He returned to teach at his alma mater as a visiting professor in 1968 and took a
            teaching position at Brooklyn College which he retained until his death of liver cancer
            in 1997.</p>

            as well- a recording of an interview with Ginsberg a reel to reel tape of Ginsberg
            singing poems of William Blake. </p>

            <scopecontent><p>This series includes manuscripts of writing both by Ginsberg and by his friends
                  and collaborators, including the manuscript for Ginsberg's <title render="italic">Indian Journals</title> and the galleys for <title render="italic">Howl and
                     Other Poems.</title> There are a number of Gregory Corso's poetry manuscripts
                  as well as some poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure, and some examples
                  of Jack Kerouac's poetry and prose, including a scroll that includes a partial
                  draft of <title render="italic">Mexico City Blues.</title>
                    </p>
               <p>Of particular interest and importance in this series is William S. Burroughs's
                  "Interzone" manuscript-- the working title of what was later published as <title render="italic">Naked Lunch.</title> The manuscript was submitted to City
                  Lights Publishing, but rejected and returned to Allen Ginsberg who was acting as
                  Burroughs's literary agent. </p>
