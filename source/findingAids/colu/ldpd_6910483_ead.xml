         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Mitchell Ginsberg was a social worker, and an educator and
            scholar in the field of social work and social justice. He was a professor and Dean at
            the Columbia University School of Social Work and a past president of the National
            Conference on Social Welfare and the National Association of Social Workers.</p>
         <p>Ginsberg was born in 1915 in Boston, Massachusetts and attended Tufts University where
            he received a B.S. in 1937 and an M.A. in education and psychology in 1938. He was
            awarded the M.S. in social work from Columbia University's School of Social Work in
            1941. </p>
         <p>After completing his education Ginsberg worked as a social worker for the U.S. Army and
            then as a case worker in Manchester, New Hampshire; Boston; and New York City before
            returning to Columbia in 1953 to join the faculty of the school of Social Work. </p>
         <p>He took a leave of absence from teaching in 1966 to become Commissioner of the New York
            City Department of Social Services under Mayor John Lindsay. In 1968, he became Human
            Resources Administrator, a position responsible for all of New York's social welfare
            programs.</p>
         <p>He returned to Columbia in 1971 as dean of the School of Social Work. He helped to found
            Columbia Community Services and served as the director for Columbia's Center for the
            Study of Human Rights. In addition to his academic leadership, he continued his civil
            service career, serving as the chairman of the city-wide Emergency Alliance for Homeless
            Families and Children.</p>
         <p>Ginsberg was designated Professor and Dean Emeritus of the School of Social Work in
