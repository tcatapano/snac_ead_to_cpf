         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Graham Greene was one of the most widely read authors,
            playwrights and literary critics of the twentieth century. Born in Berkhamsted,
            Hertfordshire, in 1904, Henry Graham Greene was the fourth of six children. Greene was
            first educated at the Berkhamsted School where his father was headmaster. He left the
            school at age 15, and moved on to study modern history at Balliol College in Oxford. It
            was there that Greene was able to hone in his interests in politics and writing, and
            worked as editor for <title render="italic">The Oxford Outlook.</title> After college,
            Greene converted to Roman Catholicism in 1926, partially under the influence of his
            future wife, Vivien Dayrell-Browning, whom he married in 1927. Greene's interests in
            Catholicism and international politics would continue to influence his work throughout
            his lifetime. Shortly after college, Greene moved to London and worked as a copy editor
            for <title render="italic">The Times</title> for 4 years, and upon the success of his
            first novel, <title render="italic">The Man Within</title> (1929), he quit <title render="italic">The Times</title> and traveled for three years as a freelance
            journalist. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1941, Greene began working for the British Foreign Office,
            and was stationed at Freetown, Sierra Leone, for a good portion of Word War II, which
            was the setting for his well known novel, <title render="italic">The Heart of the
               Matter</title> (1948; filmed 1953). <title render="italic">The Quiet American</title>
            (filmed 1958, 2002) also draws upon Greene's experiences as an agent in Sierra Leone and
            on his experiences in Saigon. Greene wrote many short stories, novels, and
            "entertainment pieces" (such as comedies and thrillers) throughout his lifetime; his
            travels and experiences as both an agent and journalist greatly influenced his writing.
               <title render="italic">The Lawless Roads</title> (1939) and <title render="italic">The Power and the Glory</title> (1940), for example, were written after Greene
            traveled to Mexico to witness religious purges. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1966, Greene became Companion of Honour, and in 1986 he
            received an Order of Merit. Greene's success as a writer enabled him to live comfortably
            in London, Antibes, and Capri, and he would continue to travel and write until old age
            prevented him from doing so. Greene died at the age of 86 in Vevey, Switzerland, on
            April 13th, 1991.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>This collection of correspondences consists almost entirely of letters to Greene's close
            friend, Mercia Ryhiner Schwob Tinker Harrison, from 1953 to 1990. The letters describe
            personal matters as well as events in Greene's career as a writer, playwright, and
            journalist. Most of the letters are correspondences describing Greene's whereabouts and
            his plans to visit Harrison; the letters briefly address Greene's literary pursuits and
            his personal relationship with Harrison. Four letters to Harrison from other people are
            included in this collection as well. The collection also contains many postcards and
            Christmas cards from Greene to Harrison, spanning almost twenty years from the 1950s to
            1969.</p>
