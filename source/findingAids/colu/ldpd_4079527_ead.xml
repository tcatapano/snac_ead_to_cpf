         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Born in Brooklyn, New York on May 6, 1909, Dr. Blau received his elementary and high
            school education in the public schools of New York and New Jersey before entering
            Columbia. He was awarded his B.A. in 1931. Upon graduation he began teaching in New
            York's public schools; two years later he completed a thesis on John Biddle, the founder
            of English Unitarianism, and received an M.A. in English Literature from Columbia. In
            1934 he was awarded a fellowship for work toward the Ph.D in Columbia's Philosophy
            Department. During the following years, Dr. Blau worked as an assistant to Prof. Herbert
            W. Schneider before completing and publishing his dissertation, <title render="italic">The Christian Interpretation of the Cabala in the Renaissance</title> in 1944.</p>
         <p>In 1944 Dr. Blau joined Columbia's philosophy department. In succeeding years, he taught
            courses in American intellectual history and the philosophy of religion. In 1962 after
            teaching for nearly twenty years in the Philosophy Department, he became a member of the
            Department of Religion. He served as chairman of this newly-created department from 1965
            to 1968 and as director of graduate studies in religion from 1962 to 1974.. During these
            years Dr. Blau taught undergraduate and graduate courses and seminars and directed
            dissertations on a wide variety of subjects. He retired from active teaching in June
            1977.</p>
         <p>During his years at Columbia Dr. Blau authored and edited several books in philosophy
            and religion including <title render="italic">Social Theories of Jacksonian
               Democracy</title> (1947); <title render="italic">Cornerstones of Religious Freedom in
               America</title> (1949; revised and enlarged ed., 1965); <title render="italic">The
               Story of Jewish Philosophy</title> (1962); and <title render="italic">Modern
               Varieties of Judaism</title> (1966). He is perhaps best known for his work Men and
            Movements in American Philosophy (1952) which was translated into six languages and
            became a standard textbook in universities throughout the world. In addition he wrote
            hundreds of essays, articles and book reviews for both popular and scholarly
            journals.</p>
         <p>While a member of Columbia's.faculty, Dr. Blau was associated with many professional
            learned organizations including the American Council of Learned Societies, the American
            Philosophic Association, the American Ethical Union and the American Jewish Historical
            Society. In addition he held several research fellowships and grants from both the
            University and outside institutions.</p>
         <p>On December 28, 1986 Dr. Blau died at his home in the Riverdale section of the
            Bronx.</p>

            one may consult <title render="italic">History, Religion, and Spiritual Democracy;

         <p/>
         <p>The collection includes correspondence, manuscripts, course materials, research notes,
            minutes, clippings, reprints of articles, as well as 25 inscribed or annotated books.
            The cataloged correspondence includes letters from Alfred Kazin, Reinhold Niebuhr, and
            Alfred Knopf. The collection offers a comprehensive view of Dr. Blau's professional and
            intellectual interests during his 50 years of association with Columbia University, as
            well as an indication of his varied professional involvement with the American Council
            for Learned Societies, American Society for the study of Religion, Association for
            Jewish Studies, and the Society for Ethical Culture/American Ethical Union. </p>
         <p>The papers of Joseph Leon Blau record almost sixty years of his association with the
            University, spanning the years from 1929 when he was an undergraduate at the College
            until 1986, the year of his death, nine years after his formal retirement from teaching.
            The bulk of this material falls into the years after Dr. Blau joined the faculty in
            1944. Specifically, the collection documents Dr. Blau's scholarly interests throughout
            the 1950s and 1960s most extensively.</p>
         <p>The collection consists both of Dr. Blau's office files in the religion department and
            personal files from his home. It includes much that pertains to his tenure as a member
            of the religion and philosophy departments, as well as material from his years as a
            student and from his associations with professional societies unaffiliated with
            Columbia.</p>
         <p>The collection includes correspondence, minutes, clippings, research notes, course
            materials and manuscripts, typescripts, and reprints of articles, essays and books. It
            is divided into nine series, namely: Cataloged Correspondence; Arranged Correspondence;
            Writings; Course Materials; Research Materials; Columbia Activities; Professional
            Activities; Publicity; and Printed Materials (as well as a folder of miscellaneous
            items). Descriptions of the contents of these series appear below.</p>
         <p>The collection offers a wealth of information to researchers in the fields of philosophy
            and religion. Its greatest strength is the amount and diversity of Blau's writings which
            it contains. Most of these writings are gathered together in the Writings Series,
            although Blau's mastery of the written word is also evident in the Correspondence
            Series--in particular, in his correspondence with former teachers such as Salo Baron and
            Herbert Schneider and with colleagues. The writings in this collection document Blau's
            thoughts on subjects both arcane and popular and enable one to track his development
            from the young man with a taste for poetry to the distinguished scholar of American
            philosophy and Judaism. Specifically, the manuscripts in various stages of revision
            reveal Blau thinking through new ideas, making unexpected connections, testing the
            borders between disciplines and, always and enthusiastically, beginning new projects.
            Above all the collection reveals that Blau's mind was encyclopedic, that he defined
            philosophy and religion broadly and then sought to become an expert on both. </p>
         <p>What this collection is less able to suggest is the Blau who again and again declared
            his love for teaching and who lectured on religion and philosophy to Columbia students
            from 1944 until 1977. Although the collection contains numerous syllabi and exams, few
            lecture materials, particularly for the classes he taught in his later years, survive.
            In addition, although the collection reveals that Dr. Blau served on committees which
            were instrumental in the establishment of the Religion Department at Columbia, it offers
            little information documenting his role in this effort.</p>
         <p>Finally, researchers should note that this collection is primarily a Columbia
            collection, that is, it mostly reflects Blau's experiences at the University and,
            consequently, neglects much that Blau-- as a man committed to taking an active role in
            his community-- didn't neglect.</p>
         <p>The 1990 Addition includes correspondence with publishers, colleagues, friends, and
            family; articles, drafts of book manuscripts, addresses, and talks; Columbia course
            files, research files, and printed materials; and personal files of Blau and of his
            father Rabbi Joel Blau, 1912-1987. Among the cataloged correspondence added are 15
            letters from Salo Baron and l letter from Albert Einstein to David Rothstein.</p>
