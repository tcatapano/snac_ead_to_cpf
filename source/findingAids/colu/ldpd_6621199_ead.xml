            <abstract>This collection consists of scripts and other materials related to the work of
                American radio, stage, and screen writer and producer Louis Dropkin. It provides
                insight into the nature of a journeyman writer/producer's professional life during
                the years when television first began to challenge radio for mass media dominance in
                the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Louis "Lou" Dropkin pursued a career in the entertainment
                industry at a particularly interesting time in its history. In 1948, there were
                fewer than one million television sets in the United States; by the mid-1950s, there
                were more than thirty-five times that number. The 1940s and 1950s saw television
                become a fixture in United States homes while radio's claim to being America's
                dominant national entertainment medium had its denouement. As a writer and producer
                for both radio and television during these years, Lou Dropkin was right in the
                middle of this transition. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Though much of Dropkin's early writing experience appears
                to have consisted of short essays, by the mid-1940s he had found both a talent for
                writing dramatic scripts and a professional partnership with his fellow New Yorker,
                Felix Leon. Their early collaborations focused on radio scripts that ranged from
                dark looks at topical events such as the drama "Is Hitler Dead" to the sentimental
                and somewhat tongue-in-cheek "By a Nose," a story of the strong bond between a
                carousel horse and his young rider, both of which were produced in 1946. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Dropkin and Leon partnership was suspended briefly from
                1946-1947, when Dropkin left New York to take a job writing, editing, directing, and
                producing radio programs for WBAL in Baltimore. According to one of his former
                employers at WBAL, while there Dropkin focused on "dramatic, public service and
                those special last minute shows which seem to be a part of radio," and his extant
                scripts from that period demonstrate a particular focus on documentary and public
                service programs that ranged from histories of Baltimore to an examination of the
                dangers of tuberculosis. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Dropkin continued his radio work after he returned to New
                York in late 1947, most notably helping to produce WNEW's weekly "The American
                Spirit!" series. Airing in the early 1950s, this program--in the words of the
                introduction to each episode--sought "to illustrate musically and dramatically
                various aspects of the American spirit" and "to provide a hearing for young actors"
                by adapting plays by some of America's most famous playwrights (including Eugene
                O'Neill, Robert E. Sherwood, and Maxwell Anderson) and having them performed on the
                radio by aspiring actors from the Professional Training Program of the American
                Theatre Wing. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->It was during this period, however, that Dropkin also began
                to focus his creative efforts on the emerging medium of television. His training in
                documentary work from his radio days undoubtedly helped this endeavor, netting him
                opportunities at NBC's New York affiliate, WNBT, in the early 1950s for which
                Dropkin produced several short nonfiction pieces. At least one of these
                programs--about the state of New York City's disaster preparedness plans--was hosted
                by the noted early television personality Ben Grauer, and was the type of show that
                proved instrumental in solidifying Grauer's transition from radio to television.
                Nevertheless, it appears that Dropkin's real creative passion after his return to
                New York was writing the short vaudeville-style sketches which characterized many
                early television offerings of the time. In this pursuit, he found the revival of his
                partnership with Felix Leon to be particularly fruitful. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Though they occasionally tried their hands at other
                genres--such as the three-act stage play "An Eagle in the House," or comic songs
                like "I Dillied When I Should Have Dallied"--Dropkin and Leon's bread-and-butter
                pieces were short farces that revolved around misunderstandings, counterintuitive
                situations, and physical gags. In "The Second Report," for example, Dropkin and Leon
                poked fun at a Kinsey-esque sex researcher who seemingly had interest in the sexual
                habits of every woman but his wife. "The Child is the Father of the Man" featured a
                son and daughter telling off their curfew-breaking parents, while "The Home Life of
                an Eskimo" found its punch line in a polar bear who, having eaten the husband and
                assumed his place in the family igloo, finds himself beholden to the same nagging
                wife that drove the husband outside and into the bear's clutches in the first place. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Dropkin and Leon found some success in television with
                their sketches, getting at least one ("The Missing Check") performed by Sid Caesar
                on the <title render="italic">Admiral Broadway Revue</title>--a variety show
                better-known by its later name, <title render="italic">Your Show of
                Shows</title>--in 1949. (They would later write several pieces specifically with the
                emerging comic star Caesar in mind.) But Dropkin's and Leon's sketches also show
                signs of the transitioning nature of the television industry in the late 1940s and
                early 1950s. For example, many of their scripts appear to have been written with
                either stage or television in mind, sometimes with multiple versions apparently
                intended for one medium or the other. Equally telling, the pair seems to have
                curtailed their writing of vaudeville-style sketches after producing a flurry of
                them in the late 1940s, indicating that Dropkin and Leon were adapting to the
                general trend of television in the 1950s to eschew the variety shows that
                characterized its initial years in favor of programming such as game shows, news and
                public service programs, and serial dramas and comedies. Indeed, as the 1950s wore
                on and television programming became more regularized, Dropkin and Leon collaborated
                on screen treatments and longer scripts and appear to have abandoned the sketch
                format entirely. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lou Dropkin was a writer who came of age in a time of
                tremendous technological and cultural change, and he seems to have been keenly aware
                of the opportunities of his moment. Even while making a career in radio, he kept an
                eye on other media, as indicated by a copy of a 1945 essay by the filmmaker Leo
                Hurwitz that Dropkin saved along with the drafts of his scripts. Titled "The
                Director's Job," it set out to analyze the different tasks of and creative
                potentials for directors in radio, stage, film, and television productions. "The
                television medium is at the beginning of a long road," wrote Hurwitz, and it turned
                out to be a road that Lou Dropkin and others like him were instrumental in paving.
                While Dropkin's work is largely forgotten today, it seems safe to say that without
                writers, producers, and directors like him, radio and television in the 1940s and
                1950s would not have existed as they did. Little is known about Dropkin's life after
                this period, though he died in late 1997 at the age of 82.</p>

            <p>By the far the largest types of material in the Louis Dropkin Papers are scripts for
                radio, stage, and television shows dating from the 1940s and 1950s. Many of these
                scripts appear in multiple drafts and contain handwritten corrections. Some of them
                have note cards indicating which producers they were distributed to. The Louis
                Dropkin Papers also include some short prose pieces, songs, manuscripts by authors
                other than Dropkin, and a small collection of correspondence related to his
                professional life.</p>

                <scopecontent><p>Nearly every item in this series is a production copy of a radio script, many
                        of which were written by Dropkin and at least some of which were produced by
                        him. There are also a few manuscript drafts for which production status is
                        indeterminable. The scripts in this series cover a range of topics, but the
                        two biggest groups include radio dramas and documentaries.</p>
                    <p>Of particular note in this series are scripts from two radio serials with
                        which Dropkin was intimately involved: "The American Spirit" and "Mount
                        Vernon Place." Each episode of the former program featured an adaptation of
                        a story from some of the United States' most famous playwrights performed by
                        aspiring actors from the American Theatre Wing, a professional group with
                        which Dropkin was associated. The latter program was a documentary series
                        that focused on Baltimore and Maryland history, aired by Dropkin's long-time
                        employer, the Baltimore radio station WBAL.</p>
                    <p>Folders in Series II are arranged in alphabetical order according to program
                        series title unless no such title is evident. In these cases, folders have
                        been arranged by episode title. The folder title indicates those folders in
                        this series which include multiple drafts of the same script or materials
                        that are not a script (eg., correspondence).</p>

                    <scopecontent><p>This subseries consists of three distinct types of material written by
                            people other than Dropkin: correspondence, forms, and creative writings.
                            The correspondence concerns Dropkin's professional life exclusively, and
                            includes letters from potential producers of his work, letters of
                            reference from former employers, and letters concerning programs he was
                            producing. The two forms in this subseries include an American Theatre
                            Wing workshop schedule that included several of the works and authors
                            found in this collection and a standard intellectual property waiver
                            from the National Broadcasting Company. The creative writings in this
                            subseries include a range of sketches, songs, and essays, perhaps the
                            most noteworthy of which is Leo Hurwitz's essay on the similarities of
                            and differences between directing stage, radio, television, and movie
                            productions.</p>
