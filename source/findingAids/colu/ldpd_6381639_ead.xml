            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The African-American opera composer Harry Lawrence Freeman,
                son of Lemuel Freeman and Agnes Sims-Freeman, was born in 1869 in Cleveland, Ohio.
                The Freeman family had been free landholders in Cleveland for several decades before
                the Civil War. Agnes is said to have had a beautiful singing voice, and young Harry
                showed exceptional musical abilities at an early age. By age 12, he organized a
                boy's vocal quartet, in which he sang first treble, and worked as a church organist.
                Self-taught, he began composing at the age of 18, after being inspired by a
                performance of Wagner's <title render="italic">Tannhause</title>r. By 1891, Freeman
                had organized the Freeman Grand Opera Company in Denver, Colorado. His first operas,
                    <title render="italic">Epthalia</title> and <title render="italic">The
                Martyr</title>, were performed by the Freeman Grand Opera Company in Denver's
                Deutsches Theater in 1891 and 1893 respectively. Freeman wrote the libretti as well
                as composing the music for these two pieces, as he did for all of his operas except
                for <title render="italic">Uzziah</title>. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1893 Freeman returned to Cleveland, where <title render="italic">The Martyr</title> had its second production at the German
                Theatre in 1894. Around 1893 Freeman began studying theory and composition formally
                with Johann Beck, then the conductor of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra. Beck
                identified Freeman's promise as a composer immediately, saying, "Freeman has some of
                the important qualities of character that made Wagner great. His compositions are
                wonderfully big in conception, the music faithfully portraying the sentiment of the
                words." Perhaps because of this comment, Freeman was dubbed "the colored Wagner" in
                the press, a sobriquet that stayed with him all his life. Freeman's music shows
                Wagner's influence in his use of leitmotifs and orchestration; also, Freeman planned
                to write a cycle of four music-dramas based on African myths, probably inspired by
                Richard Wagner's 'Ring Cycle' of four operas based on Norse mythology. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->From about 1894-1904, H. Lawrence Freeman wrote and
                published a number of popular songs as "Harry Freeman," earning him a reputation as
                a 'hit' composer in certain circles (in his later works the composer was identified
                exclusively as "H. Lawrence Freeman"). From 1895-1899, Freeman toured with Ernest
                Hogan's Rufus Rastus company, writing some of the music for Hogan's blackface
                musical comedies. In 1899, Freeman married actress and singer Charlotte ("Carlotta")
                Louise Thomas, the daughter of a prominent black family from Charleston, South
                Carolina. In January of 1900, their son Valdo Lawrence Freeman was born. Also in
                1900, Johann Beck conducted the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra in excerpts from three
                operas by Freeman, a prestigious symphonic debut for a young American composer,
                which generated much attention in the press. H. Lawrence Freeman then became the
                director of the music program at Wilberforce University in Xenia, Ohio, from
                1902-1904, where he directed a student production of his opera <title render="italic">African Kraal</title> in 1903. From 1906-1907, both H. Lawrence
                and Carlotta Freeman worked at the newly-formed Pekin Theatre in Chicago, the first
                theatre of its kind to be entirely run by and performed in by African-Americans. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Around 1908, the Freeman family moved to New York City.
                They founded the Friends' Amusement Guild in their Harlem brownstone, which grew
                from a gathering of a few neighbors every Sunday afternoon for music or readings to
                an organization of several hundred members that produced theatre, opera, charity
                concerts, and a host of other activities. Carlotta continued working as an actress
                and later as a stage director, with the Anita Bush Stock Company, the Lafayette
                Players, and other groups. According to interviews with Valdo Freeman, she also
                performed occasionally with 'legitimate' (i.e. Caucasian) theatre companies by
                passing as Latin American or of Mediterranean descent-as such, she was one of the
                first black actresses to work in white theatres. H. Lawrence Freeman continued to
                work in musical comedy in New York, while also pursuing his operatic composing,
                becoming interested in a fusion of the two which he called "Jazz Opera." He served
                as musical director for the Cole-Johnson Brothers Company from 1909-1910, which
                produced popular "Tin Pan Alley" musicals, and afterwards was musical director of
                the John Larkins Musical Comedy Company for a few years. He also founded and
                conducted the Negro Choral Society, a chorus of about 75 voices, starting in 1912.
                In 1920 the Freemans founded the Negro Grand Opera Company, a group designed to
                mount H. Lawrence's operas and provide performance opportunities for
                African-American singers. The same year, H. Lawrence Freeman founded his own music
                school in Harlem, the Salem School of Music, which was renamed a few years later the
                Freeman School of Music. From about 1920 onwards, Valdo Freeman acted as his
                father's business manager, seeking out opportunities for production and publication
                of the operas--he was the manager of the Negro Grand Opera Company and also became
                executive director of the Friends Amusement Guild. All three Freemans became thickly
                embedded in the cultural life of the Harlem Renaissance, with their brownstone
                serving as an impromptu salon for figures such as Eubie Blake, Noble Sissle, Marion
                Anderson, Muriel Rahn, and Lena Horne in later years. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->By the late 1920s, H. Lawrence's work was becoming
                well-known in New York, through his performances, teaching, and his work as a
                musical critic and essayist for the <title render="italic">New Amsterdam
                News</title> and the <title render="italic">Afro-American</title> newspapers. In
                1928 his opera <title render="italic">Voodoo</title> was produced at the 52nd Street
                Theater, and a concert performance of the same opera was broadcast live over the
                radio station WGBS. Freeman received the Harmon Award for significant achievement by
                an African-American in the field of arts and letters in 1930; the other 11
                recipients included Adam Clayton Powell. Later the same year he played excerpts from
                several of his operas at Carnegie Hall. In 1934 he was the composer and musical
                director of the pageant "O Sing a New Song," a high-profile event at the Chicago
                World's Fair which celebrated the African-American experience. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The late-1930s saw a few productions and many failed
                attempts at production of Freeman's operas, most significantly a production of
                    <title render="italic">Vendetta</title> at the Park Palace in 1937. Valdo was
                especially interested in seeing his father's work produced at 'mainstream' rather
                than historically black venues, and during this period he contacted the Metropolitan
                opera, a few of the Broadway theatres, and several major concert halls. The
                Freemans' work was largely suspended during World War II, but Valdo's efforts were
                rewarded in 1947 by a production of <title render="italic">The Martyr</title> at
                Carnegie Hall. H. Lawrence conducted an interracial cast that included Muriel Rahn
                and Louis Rocca. The production received reviews from both mainstream and
                African-American newspapers; while most critics agreed that it was a historic
                moment, many noted that the work was unfinished (not completely orchestrated) and
                needed polishing. Some objected to Freeman's mixture of jazz and African song forms
                with more traditional elements of Western classical music such as the dacapo aria.
                This and many other performances of Freeman's operas were criticized for having
                inadequate orchestras; Valdo Freeman later said that hiring and rehearsing the
                instrumentalists was one of the most difficult parts of his father's productions,
                given the need for the musicians to be comfortable with both Western classical and
                jazz styles. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In the late 1940s, H. Lawrence Freeman began developing the
                Aframerican Opera Foundation, a group that would promote black composers and
                singers, and also offer opera in a smaller, more accessible format to a wider
                audience. Among other luminaries, he asked Eleanor Roosevelt to sit on the board of
                directors. He also sought publication of his monograph, <title render="italic">The
                    Negro in Classical Music and Opera</title>, in the early 1950s, but the
                manuscript was criticized for lack of scholarly methods and significant revisions
                were recommended. Both projects were cut short by H. Lawrence Freeman's death on
                March 24, 1954; Carlotta died only three months later, on June 11, 1954. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Valdo married Anita Grannum (1908-1999) in 1954, after the
                death of his parents. The Grannums were long-time friends of the Freeman famil--
                Hugh P. Grannum, Anita's father, was a publisher who knew H. Lawrence and Valdo
                professionally, and Anita's sisters Alberta and Kathlyn Grannum had sung in the 1947
                production of <title render="italic">The Martyr</title>. After their marriage, Valdo
                and Anita became involved with the Negro Actors' Guild; Valdo served as
                administrative secretary from 1965 until his death in 1972, and Anita continued to
                work there as chairwoman of the board until about 1980. Anita was a graduate of the
                law school at St. John's University, and it was with her legal expertise that Valdo
                began the process of conserving his father's estate. After Anita's death in 1999, H.
                Lawrence Freeman's scores and other papers were passed to her sister Kathlyn, and
                then to her niece Holly Zuber-Banks.</p>

            <p>The Harry Lawrence Freeman Collection provides an assortment of material related to
                American opera and to the artistic performance and social history of
                African-Americans from about 1890-1950. They include the original manuscript scores
                to 21 of his operas. These present the fullest picture available of the composer's
                intentions and artistic process. Freeman's non-musical work is also represented,
                including drafts of his unpublished book, <title render="italic">The Negro in
                    Classical Music and Opera</title>, plays, libretti, and journal articles. The
                musical scores are accompanied by documentation of the production of his operas,
                including programs, advertising, correspondence, clippings, schedules and budgets,
                and production designs. Production documentation also exists for the work of
                Carlotta Freeman as an actress and stage director with many historic black theatre
                companies, including the Lafayette Players, the Anita Bush Stock Company, and the
                Pekin Theatre. Images, from daguerreotypes and paintings to casual snapshots, are
                included in the Collection. Many prominent African-American performers inscribed
                headshots or publicity photos to one or more of the Freemans, which are present.
                There are several large-format paintings and framed photos by the artist Edward
                Elcha depicting the Freemans, sometimes in costume. The Freemans founded three arts
                organizations-- the Friends' Amusement Guild, the Negro Grand Opera Company, and the
                Aframerican Opera Foundation-- and records of each, comprising stock,
                correspondence, ephemera, and receipts are included in the collection. Valdo and
                Anita Freeman were also involved with the Negro Actors' Guild, and some documents
                relating to this organization are also present. Several scrapbooks are included,
                most from the early twentieth century, with clippings, programs, and other ephemera
                related to H. Lawrence Freeman's career. Recordings of two interviews with Valdo
                Freeman talking about his father and playing excerpts from his father's work, are
                also present in the collection. Lastly, there is a small amount of personal
                documents and ephemera, including a violin that belonged either to H. Lawrence or
                Valdo Freeman.</p>

                    <scopecontent><p> The heart of the collection, this series, contains Freeman’s original
                            manuscript scores, including full scores, piano-vocal reductions, and
                            orchestral parts in Freeman’s hand. Twenty-one operas are represented,
                            along with songs, cantatas, a "symphonic poem," and a short ballet. For
                            some operas, many drafts are present, from initial pencil piano-vocal
                            sketches to beautifully bound ink copies of the full score. Freeman
                            seems to have done almost all of his copying himself, leaving a wealth
                            of autograph scores. Operas are organized alphabetically by title, with
                            all drafts and parts of one work together in roughly chronological
                            sequence. </p>

                            scores: "The Slaying of the Lion," <title render="italic">Voodoo</title>
                            (Act III only), and "Zulu King (Witch Hunt)." It also houses all
                            published scores by Freeman present in the collection. Most of the
                            published scores are originals, but some are in photocopy form. All
                            scores in this subseries are songs, not operas or symphonic works, and
                            many are arrangements of well-known spirituals. Two of the earliest
                            published songs (1896-1897, with only photocopies extant) were also
                            published by a "Harry Freeman" in Chicago – they may have been
                            self-published, or the name may be a coincidence. Two songs from 1925
                            were published by Valdo Freeman. The songs are arranged chronologically
                            by publication date. Also included are printed scores by other
                            composers. Selections range from Brahms to arrangements of spirituals;
                            the bulk are early-twentieth-century songs by African-American composers
                            such as T.H. Burleigh, W.C. Handy and Noble Sissle. They are arranged
                            alphabetically by the composer’s last name. </p>

                        the performance activities of the Freemans make up the bulk of this series.
                        Highlights include 12 exquisite watercolor costume designs by Amos Dickenson
                        for <title render="italic">The Martyr</title>, circa 1920, and rare programs
                        from such historic African-American theatres as the Pekin, the New Lincoln,
                        the Anita Bush Stock Company, and others. The folder of receipts from
                        1920-1924 was removed from an accordion file found in the collection. The
                        original order of the receipts has been preserved, although it is not always
                        chronological. Many expenses relate to the formation of the Negro Grand
                        Opera Company, which occurred during this period. Programs kept by the
                        Freemans for events in which they did not perform, but probably attended,
                        are also included. </p>

                <scopecontent><p> This series is an exceptionally rich gathering of early visual material of
                        African-Americans, including paintings, daguerreotypes, and publicity
                        photographs, and snapshots. Many images portray the Freemans or their
                        colleagues in costume or during performance. There is a large group of
                        ‘headshot’ photos of performers, many of which are inscribed to various
                        members of the Freeman family: highlights include photographs of Anita Bush,
                        Charles Gilpin, Dorothy Mayner, and the Cole-Johnson brothers. Because of
                        the lack of dates on many images, they are primarily organized by size and
                        medium, with categorization by date or subject where possible. For a list of
                        all identified sitters, please see Appendix B. </p>

                        to production of H. Lawrence’s operas. Other highlights include several
                        letters from Carlotta to Valdo, 1915-1918, when she was touring with a
                        theatrical company, and a letter from H. Lawrence to Edward Hipsher with a

                <scopecontent><p> Material relating to several different arts organizations in which the
                        Freeman family participated is gathered in this series. The material is
                        organized in alphabetical order by group name. Materials from the
                        Aframerican Opera Foundation include cards, letterhead, and contracts for
                        this organization, and a roll book of members for an earlier version of this
                        group, the Aframerican Opera Guild, from the early 1940s. The Friends
                        Amusement Guild folder includes tickets, fliers, a membership card, a
                        newsletter from 1933, a list of members, and a poem by Leo Evans about the
                        group. Valdo Freeman served as Administrative Secretary for the Negro
                        Actors’ Guild from the mid-1960s until his death in 1972; during the late
                        1970s Anita continued her husband’s work as chairwoman of various
                        committees. Most of the material related to the Negro Actors’ Guild is from
                        Anita’s work with the group’s assistance program for members who fell on
                        hard times. It also includes a few newsletters from the period of Valdo’s
                        work with the organization, including one memorializing him shortly after
                        his death, and a certificate of memorial for H. Lawrence Freeman. One
                        clipping from the organization’s newspaper in 1939 is present, but partially
                        deteriorated. Documents from the Negro Grand Opera Company include contracts
                        between the three Freemans and the company, books of stock certificates and
                        records of stock sold, and ephemera including promotional materials about
                        the group, an embossing press, letterhead, and a copperplate block for
                        printing the company’s logo. (For more financial records of this
                        organization, please see Series III: Performance Documentation, Box 12,
                        Folder 6, "Financial Documents," many of which relate to the Negro Grand
                        Opera Company.) </p>
