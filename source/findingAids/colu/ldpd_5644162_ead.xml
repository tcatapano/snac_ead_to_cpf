         <abstract>This collection contains the papers of Barry Ulanov, a jazz critic and professor
            of English at Barnard College. The bulk of the papers relates to Ulanov’s Barnard years
            (1950-2000). Most of the material consists of book manuscripts, research files, course
            materials, and correspondence. </abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Barry Ulanov (1918-2000) was a jazz critic, professor of
            English at Barnard College, and prolific writer. He wrote, edited, or translated nearly
            fifty books and over a thousand articles on a wide range of subjects. His interests
            included music, modern art, psychology, history, religion, and literature. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ulanov was born in Manhattan on April 10, 1918 and attended
            Columbia University, where he took advantage of his proximity to Harlem to immerse
            himself in jazz music and culture. After receiving his BA in 1939, Ulanov worked as a
            jazz writer and edited the journal <title render="italic">Metronome</title> from 1943 to
            1955. He shifted the focus of the journal to cover more jazz and be-bop music,
            particularly black musicians who had previously received little notice in the journal.
            From 1955 to 1958 he wrote for <title render="italic">Down Beat</title> and published
            several biographies of jazz musicians in the 1940s and 1950s. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1939, Ulanov married Joan Bel Geddes, who had been a
            student at Barnard during his years at Columbia. This marriage lasted 29 years and
            produced three children: Anne, Nicholas, and Katherine. In 1968, Ulanov married Ann
            Belford, with whom he later had a son, Alexander. Ann Belford Ulanov taught at Union
            Theological Seminary as Professor of Psychiatry and Religion. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ulanov's interest in the connection between modern art and
            contemporary American culture led him to pursue a Ph.D. in English Literature at
            Columbia University, which he completed in 1955. In the meantime, he also became
            involved in architectural projects in Denver, Colorado and Long Island. He taught
            English Literature at Princeton University from 1951 to 1953, and then, from 1953 to
            1988, at Barnard College. He was an adjunct professor of Religion at Columbia University
            and, after retiring from Barnard, he taught at Union Theological Seminary in the
            Department of Psychiatry and Religion. Ulanov lectured worldwide on a range of topics. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ulanov converted to Catholicism in 1951 and became involved
            with the Catholic Renaissance Society. He was an active member of the Vatican II
            Council, where he advocated for the use of vernacular in the mass and amplified music in
            church. Ulanov lectured at a number of Catholic colleges and spoke at the International
            Eucharistic Congress with Pope John XXIII in Bombay in 1964. He wrote and edited
            numerous books and articles on religion and culture. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In his last twenty years, Ulanov wrote extensively on religion
            and psychology, publishing over ten books with his second wife, Ann Belford Ulanov.
            Until his death, they co-edited the <title render="italic">Journal of Religion and
               Health.</title> Ulanov died on April 30, 2000, at the age of 82.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The collection contains professional and research files, manuscripts, and documents of
            Barry Ulanov. Subject files include mostly pamphlets, flyers, clippings and copies of
            newspapers and journals relating to Ulanov's research interests, both for specific book
            projects as well as more generally. Contained, too, are extensive materials related to
            Ulanov's Barnard courses, such as syllabi, reading lists, correspondence, and relevant
            course readings. These subject files are comprised of both those files created by
            Ulanov, and those created during processing. The papers also include many of Ulanov's
            original manuscripts and translations, particularly his works on history of religion and
            Jungian psychology, as well as manuscripts sent to him by colleagues and associates,
            such as Lionel Trilling. Also included within the collection is Ulanov's correspondence,
            primarily relating to his speaking and lecturing as part of his professorship at Barnard
            College. There is also a large amount of correspondence which reflects his extensive
            work for the Catholic Church, as both a lecturer for Church organizations and as
            president of the Catholic Renaissance Society.</p>

                  the 2000s. The correspondence within the collection consists primarily of letters
                  regarding Ulanov’s professional activity, particularly as a lecturer and speaker,
                  as well as his work within the Catholic Church. Of particular interest is a
                  handwritten letter to Ulanov from Charles Mingus. The correspondence is arranged
                  chronologically by decade.</p>
