         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Carlyle J. Frarey was a library professional active between
            the end of the Second World War and his death in 1976. Carlyle was born in Springwater,
            New York, in 1918, and graduated from Oberlin College in 1939. </p>
         <p>After serving in the Army Air Force during World War II, Frarey enrolled in the Master's
            program at the Columbia University School of Library Service. He graduated from Columbia
            in 1952 and accepted an assistant librarian position in the Duke University Library. In
            1954, Frarey began teaching library students as an Assistant Professor at the University
            of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He held this position for several years, teaching and
            serving as Acting Dean, before returning to Columbia as a senior lecturer and Assistant
            to the Dean of the School of Library Service.</p>
         <p>Frarey worked at Columbia for the remainder of his life. He was an active participant in
            professional organizations and a frequent contributor to academic publications until the
            time of his death in 1976.</p>
