            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Tibor Serly was born in Losonc, Hungary on November 25,
                1901. He began his musical studies with his father, Lajos Serly, a Hungarian
                patriot, theatrical composer, and pupil of Liszt. Due to financial hardships, Lajos
                Serly moved his family in 1905 to New York City, where Tibor spent his childhood.
                Tibor gained early experience in pit orchestras led by his father until 1922, when
                he returned to Budapest to attend the Liszt Academy. There, he studied violin with
                Jenö Hubay, composition with Zoltán Kodály, and orchestration with Leó Weiner,
                graduating in 1925 with highest honors. During his years in Budapest, Serly also
                first made the acquaintance of his longtime mentor and friend, Béla Bartók. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Serly returned to the United States upon graduation and
                held positions as a violinist and violist in leading American orchestras, including
                the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Eugene Ormandy and the NBC
                Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini. He also became close friends with several
                modernist poets, including William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky, Basil Bunting,
                and most notably Ezra Pound, whom Serly visited frequently at Pound's home in
                Rapallo, Italy, arranging concerts there. In 1938, Serly retired from performing to
                focus on composing and teaching. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1940, Béla Bartók and his wife emigrated from wartime
                Hungary to New York. Until Bartók's death in 1944, Serly devoted his energies to
                providing material and emotional support to the ailing exiled composer. Serly's
                papers include intimate photographs of Bartók and himself, as well as a home movie
                of an informal piano performance by Bartók. Serly arranged the <title render="italic">Mikrokosmos</title> suite for chamber orchestra, orchestrated
                the <title render="italic">Third Concerto for Piano,</title> and posthumously
                completed the master's <title render="italic">Concerto for Viola</title> from
                sketches of the work. A talented decipherer and stylist, Serly also reconstructed a
                duet by Liszt and a section of Schubert's unfinished <title render="italic">Eighth
                    Symphony.</title>
            </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->From the 1930s on, Serly engaged in serious theoretical
                studies, developing a post-Schoenbergian enharmonic system called <title render="italic">Modus Lascivus,</title> which divides the twelve-tone scale into
                two segments to create a multimodal chromatic scale system. Serly published two
                advanced theoretical texts, <title render="italic">A Second Look at Harmony</title>
                (1964) and <title render="italic">Modus Lascivus: The Road to Enharmonicism</title>
                (1976), and had just completed a third, <title render="italic">The Rhetoric of
                    Melody,</title> at the time of his death. Serly was also working on both a
                personal memoir and a biography of Bartók, the unfinished typescripts of which are
                included in these papers. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Towards the end of his life, Serly relocated with his
                second wife, the pianist Miriam Molin, to Longview, Washington, where he continued
                to teach and actively championed modernist music in the Pacific Northwest. At the
                end of his career, Serly was better known for his famous friends and collaborators,
                especially Bartók and Pound, than his own musical and theoretical work, a fact
                about which he complained bitterly in later correspondence. He was, however,
                indefatigable in his commitment to both innovation in modern music and preserving
                the rich musical traditions in which he had played a central role. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Tibor Serly died on October 8, 1978 after being struck by a
                car on a visit to London. His devoted wife Miriam, who kept his work alive through
                her performances, compiled the papers in this collection.</p>
