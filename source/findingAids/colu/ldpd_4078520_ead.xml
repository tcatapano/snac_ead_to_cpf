         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->James Grover McDonald was born on November 29, 1886 in
            Coldwater, Ohio. His parents, Kenneth and Anna Dietrich McDonald, operated a hotel, and
            the family's five children worked alongside their parents. The family later moved to
            Albany, Indiana, to operate a second hotel, and there McDonald met Ruth Stafford, whom
            he would marry in 1915. The couple would have two daughters, Barbara Ann and Janet. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->McDonald studied at Indiana University, earning an A.B. degree
            in 1909 and a master's in History, Political Science, and International Relations in
            1910. He won a teaching fellowship in history at Harvard Graduate School and then
            returned to Indiana University in 1914 as assistant professor of history. He taught
            until 1918, with a break in 1915-1916 to visit Spain as a Harvard University traveling
            fellow. He also taught summer sessions in international affairs at the University of
            Georgia in 1916 and 1917. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->At the recommendation of his Harvard advisors, McDonald moved
            to New York City and took a position with the Civil Service Reform Association, which
            was committed to ending government corruption. From 1919 to 1933, McDonald served as
            chairman of the Foreign Policy Association, an organization dedicated to educating the
            public about foreign affairs. McDonald presided over Foreign Policy Association
            Luncheons, which were broadcast over WEAF and NBC. During the late 1920s and early
            1930s, he gave weekly talks on international relations over the same radio stations,
            speaking on current world events. McDonald traveled extensively and made trips to
            Germany nearly every year, experiencing Hitler's rise to power firsthand. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1933, McDonald became League of Nations High Commissioner
            for Refugees and was faced with the task of negotiating refugee possibilities with
            Germany prior to World War II. In a meeting with Hitler in 1933, he became aware of Nazi
            goals to exterminate the Jewish population. McDonald struggled to help Jews and other
            persecuted individuals leave Germany, but found that his ability was restrained by
            League policies. He was respected and admired for his efforts and was awarded the
            American Hebrew Medal for Promotion of Better Understanding between Christian and Jew in
            America. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1935, McDonald resigned from the position. In his
            resignation letter, he detailed the mistreatment of minorities in Germany and urged the
            League of Nations to take proactive measures not only to help refugees, but to recognize
            and address the problems in Germany that forced them to leave in the first place. The
            letter was widely circulated and was one of the first denouncements of the Nazi
            government by an international diplomat. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->McDonald returned to New York, and from 1936 to1938 he worked
            on the editorial staff of the <title render="italic"> New York Times</title>, specializing in editorials on
            international relations. In 1938 he returned to the problems of the refugees, serving as
            chairman of the President's Advisory Commission on Political Refugees. The Commission
            was involved mainly in working with the State Department to adapt immigration laws to
            the crisis in Germany. McDonald served on the Commission until 1945. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1946, McDonald served with the Anglo-American Committee of
            Inquiry on Palestine, a British and American committee charged with forming a policy on
            the admission of Jews into Palestine. McDonald traveled throughout the reason to hear
            the testimony of Jews and Palestinians, and became a strong supporter of unlimited
            immigration into Palestine by European refugees, and of the eventual creation of the
            state of Israel. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1948, President Truman asked McDonald to serve as a U.S.
            representative to Israel, and McDonald moved to the newly formed country along with his
            daughter, Barbara. The following year, he became the first U.S. ambassador to Israel and
            served for two years, working to forge a strong connection between the two countries
            during a period of upheaval. McDonald resigned as ambassador in 1951 and returned to the
            US, where he became chairman of the Advisory Council of the Development Corporation for
            Israel. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->McDonald wrote about his personal experience as an ambassador
            in his book <title render="italic">My Mission to Israel,</title> published in 1951. His extensive diaries, now held by
            the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, have also been published in an
            annotated, multi-volume collection, <title render="italic">The Diaries and Papers of James G. McDonald.</title>
            </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In addition to his long career in international affairs,
            McDonald was also a member of the Board of Education of the City of New York
            (1940-1942); president of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (1938-1942); and a
            member of the Harvard Club of New York. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->James G. McDonald died in 1964.</p>

         <p>This collection documents the professional and personal life of James Grover McDonald, a
            diplomat who worked extensively on refugee issues and served as the first U.S.
            ambassador to Israel. Much of the material relates to McDonald's positions on the High
            Commission for Refugees (Jewish and Other) Coming from Germany and the Presidential
            Advisory Committee on Political Refugees.  These files document international efforts to help
            minorities, primarily Jews, escape Germany prior to World War II. There is also a fair
            amount of information on McDonald's experience as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Materials
            include correspondence, speech and book drafts, pamphlets, photographs, and newspaper

                  material dates from after World War II and relates to McDonald's involvement with
                  the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine, the formation of Israel, and
                  his experience as U.S. ambassador to Israel. There is also considerable material
                  relating to refugees, as well as some personal correspondence with family and
                  friends. Files are arranged alphabetically by correspondent or institution name.
