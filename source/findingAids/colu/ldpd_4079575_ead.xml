         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Plimpton family members represented in this collection
            descend from some of the earliest English settlers of North America. From the
            seventeenth century on the Plimptons, Pearsonses, Taylors and Ameses were prominent
            families, heavily involved with higher education and with public service: John Plympton
            (sic, circa 1620-1677) arrived in Massachusetts in 1642, settling in the town of
            Medfield, where he served as constable and then as colonial Sergeant; he also
            contributed to the founding of Harvard College. Edward Taylor (1642-1729), ancestor of
            Frances Taylor Pearsons Plimpton, was a Harvard graduate (class of 1671), Puritan
            minister to the people of the frontier town of Westfield, Massachusetts, and a prolific
            poet. Oakes Ames (1804-1873), ancestor of Pauline Ames Plimpton, was a U.S. Congressman;
            his brother, Oliver Ames, played a large part in building the Transcontinental Railroad.
            Another Ames ancestor, Benjamin F. Butler (1818-1893) was a Civil War general, later a
            United States Congressman and then Massachusetts governor. Pauline's mother, Blanche
            Ames Ames (sic, 1879-1969), graduated from Smith College and worked as an artist, as an
            activist for women's rights, including access to birth control, and then as the
            President of the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston; Pauline's
            father, Oakes Ames (1874-1950), was a Harvard professor of botany. The presence of
            several genealogical documents in the collection reveal the extent to which the primary
            creators of this collection valued the heritage they received from this uncommonly
            well-educated and public-minded family. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->George Arhtur Plimpton: "Well-educated" and "public-minded"
            are only two of the qualities that may be accurately ascribed to George Arthur Plimpton
            (1855-1936). After a brief stint at Harvard Law School, he worked as the senior partner
            of the New York-based firm Ginn and Company, which published educational textbooks, but
            he also served on the board of trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy (he graduated in the
            class in 1872), Amherst College (class of 1876), Barnard College (as its first
            treasurer) and the American College for Girls/Constantinople College for Women in Turkey
            (now Robert College, Istanbul). Further, as his correspondence reveals, George Plimpton
            devoted a great deal of time and energy to global Christian educational institutions and
            relief missions; he was particularly invested in Andrew Carnegie's various peace
            organizations, serving as trustee and treasurer of the Church Peace Union. Plimpton's
            commitment to education as a public and indeed a global good is apparent in the letters
            he exchanged with several young people, some non-U.S.-citizens, whom he supported
            financially so that they could earn college degrees. (For example, see his
            correspondence with S.Y. Livingston Hu.) </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Plimpton was connected to Columbia University through two main
            channels, each of which represents one of his major passions: books and international
            affairs. An ardent bibliophile and an unparalleled collector of rare educational books,
            documents, and objects (specifically of hornbooks), as well as of medieval illuminated
            manuscripts, historical correspondence, and portraits of English authors, he founded the
            Friends of the Columbia Libraries with Professor David Eugene Smith of Teachers College.
            (Smith wrote the book <title render="italic">Rara Arithmetica</title> (1908) largely
            based on his study of Plimpton's collection, and Plimpton himself authored <title render="italic">The Education of Shakespeare</title> (1933) and The <title render="italic">Education of Chaucer</title> (1935), drawing heavily on the medieval
            and early modern educational items he had gathered.) Plimpton was also heavily involved
            in the establishment of Columbia's political science department. An early supporter and
            later treasurer of the American Academy of Political Science, he founded the journal
               <title render="italic">Political Science Quarterly</title> in 1886. Though Plimpton
            was never a professor in any university department, he was an active member not only of
            various academic political science organizations, but of the American Philological
            Society, the Modern Language Association, the Grolier Club, and various antiquarian
            societies. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Plimpton was also devoted to Lewis Farm, the estate and
            working farm he owned in Walpole, Massachusetts; these papers include several
            photographs of the residential and farm buildings, and of Plimpton and his family
            enjoying the property. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->But his letters and photographs suggest that Plimpton's
            greatest interest was reserved for his family. He writes with admiration of his first
            wife, Francis Taylor Pearsons Plimpton, and appears smiling affectionately with her in
            several photographs. After her death in 1900, Plimpton focused intensively on their son,
            Francis T.P., to whom he wrote inventive and age-appropriate letters, often in the form
            of collages illustrated by cut-outs from magazines and newspapers. Plimpton married
            Fanny Hastings in 1917, with whom he had two children, Calvin H. and Emily Plimpton.
            Calvin, a medical doctor, served as the president of Amherst College from 1960-1971. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->George Arthur Plimpton donated his rare book, historical
            correspondence and author portrait collections, containing about 20,000 items, to
            Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1935. He died in 1936. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Frances Taylor Pearsons Plimpton: Frances Taylor Pearsons
            Plimpton (1862-1900) was herself very well educated; daughter of a judge and Mount
            Holyoke College benefactor, W.B.C. Pearsons, she graduated from Wellesley College in
            1884 and later served as the President of its Alumnae Association. She was also a fine
            writer; her letters to her cousin and fellow Wellesley student Louise Pearsons, reveal
            both her warmth and her wit. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Like her husband, Frances was a collector of rare books,
            focusing on Italian books and manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Her
            husband donated her book collection to Wellesley after her death in 1900, which
            immediately followed the birth of their son, Francis T.P. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Francis T.P. Plimpton: Like his many of his ancestors, Francis
            T.P. Plimpton (1900-1983) attained prominence as a public servant. A graduate of
            Phillips Exeter Academy, Amherst College, and Harvard Law, Plimpton started practicing
            law at the New York firm of Root, Clark, and in 1933 became a senior partner at
            Debevoise, Stevenson &amp; Plimpton. He would continue to practice as a lawyer for
            several decades, earning a reputation for thoroughness and unshakeable integrity. That
            reputation led to his position as president of the Association of the Bar of the City of
            New York (1970-1972) and to the chairmanship of the New York City Board of Ethics
            (1966-1980). </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Plimpton served as deputy United States ambassador to the
            United Nations, working with his friend, the ambassador Adlai Stevenson, from 1961-1965,
            and sat on State Department advisory committees during the 1960s and 1970s. He was
            active in higher education as well as in law and in government: like his father, Francis
            devoted much energy to advising educational institutions, including those from which he
            graduated. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Throughout his career, Plimpton was unafraid to take
            progressive public stances on controversial issues: in 1963, as deputy ambassador to the
            UN, he made a visit to Pope Paul VI, urging the pontiff to change the Catholic Church's
            position on birth control. At the age of 72, he took a major role in organizing the
            lawyers' march on Washington to protest the U.S. military's bombing of Cambodia during
            the Vietnam War. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Francis Plimpton was not only a successful lawyer and
            diplomat; his writings in this collection show the verbal wit (and the social grace) for
            which he was celebrated. From his student days, Francis wrote poetry and prose, but law
            firm celebrations gave him the opportunity to perform his gently satirical light verse,
            examples of which are included in his papers in this collection. A very funny essay
            delivered as an address at the Amherst College chapel in 1957, "In Praise of Polygamy,"
            was published in several magazines and later as a pamphlet. The essay counseled the
            young men of Amherst to delay marriage for as long as possible in the interests of
            individualism and experience; he did not follow his own advice, it seems, for Francis
            was married to Pauline Ames Plimpton for over fifty years. The correspondence between
            them testifies to a strong, affectionate and devoted partnership. They had four
            children: Oakes Ames Plimpton; George Ames Plimpton, the journalist and founder of
               <title render="italic">The Paris Review;</title> Francis T.P. Plimpton, Jr.; and
            Sarah Plimpton, copies of whose artist's books are also housed in the Rare Book and
            Manuscript Library. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Pauline Ames Plimpton: The daughter of two prominent figures,
            the daughter-in-law of one renowned man and the wife of another, Pauline Ames Plimpton
            (1901-1995) came into her own as an author and editor in her late seventies. A fine
            writer, she published several books about her family and its history, including <title render="italic">Oakes Ames: Jottings of a Harvard Botanist</title> (1979); <title render="italic">The Plimpton Papers: Law and Diplomacy</title> (1985); and <title render="italic">A Collector's Recollections: George Arthur Plimpton</title> (1992). A
            graduate of Smith College (class of 1922), Pauline was throughout her adult life active
            in arts and government policy organizations including Planned Parenthood, the Public
            Education Association, the Institute for World Affairs, and the Metropolitan Museum of
            Art; she also worked with several libraries, including that of her alma mater, Smith
            College.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Plimpton Family Papers contain correspondence, personal and professional documents,
            writings and photographs produced or gathered by George Arthur Plimpton, his first wife
            Frances Taylor Pearsons Plimpton, their son Francis T.P. Plimpton, and his wife Pauline
            Ames Plimpton. While much of the correspondence is personal, significant portions of
            Francis T.P. Plimpton's and especially George Arthur Plimpton's letters relate to
            business and vocational matters. The personal documents and objects in this collection
            include baby books, baby shoes and scrapbooks, homework, bookplates, and guest lists for
            parties. Most of the photographic images, which consist of prints, slides, glass slides,
            negatives, daguerreotypes and one autochrome diascope, depict the four primary creators
            of the collection, but others depict their ancestors and descendants.</p>

               <scopecontent><p>The bulk of this subseries includes the correspondence between Francis T.P.
                     Plimpton and Pauline Ames Plimpton. When separated, due to professional or
                     family obligations or the occasional solo trip, they corresponded frequently.
                     Other correspondents include their children, parents and the extended Ames,
                     Pearsons and Plimpton families. </p>
                  <p>Also included here is the correspondence they received regarding "Letters in
                     Training" a privately published compilation of the letters George Plimpton
                     wrote to his parents while he was stationed in Italy (1945-1946). Francis and
                     Pauline distributed "Letters in Training" to their friends and family at
                     Christmas 1946. </p>
                  <p>Francis's correspondence, somewhat more extensive here than Pauline's, includes
                     correspondence with family, friends and teachers dating from his youth.
                     Pauline's correspondence contains letters regarding her writings about Villa
                     Balbianello, a property on Lake Como, Italy, purchased by her uncle, Butler
                     Ames.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>This sprawling series contains genealogies, documents and artifacts of many generations of the Plimpton, Pearsons and Ames families.  The earliest document, dated 1697, is a prose narrative by Mary Plimpton, detailing her religious conversion.  Nearly as ancient is a 1699 <title render="italic">New Testament</title> owned by D.K. Pearsons.  Less esoteric items--baby shoes, a baby book, daily agendas and personal documents--provide hints of the quotidian Plimpton family life. Caches of school work, herbarium specimens, drawings, youthful compositions, report cards and diplomas reveal the educational accomplishments of several generations.  Awards, clippings, and scrapbooks document professional achievements.  The material is arranged alphabetically.</p>

The earliest travel albums are collections of photographs of a trip to Constantinople (1914) and to China (1920). Later photo albums contain pictures of Pauline, Francis, their family and friends on their travels around the world.</p>
