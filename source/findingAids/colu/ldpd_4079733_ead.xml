         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Charles Philip Butcher (1918- ), born and raised in
            Washington, D. C., graduated from the prestigious Dunbar High School. His mother, Jennie
            Rosa Lawrence Jones Butcher, like her mother before her, was a teacher. James W. Butcher
            (1875-1950), his father, retired in 1926 from a job with the Government Printing Office
            and became a wood-worker. He was best known for the "Butcher-Built Dollhouses" that he
            crafted and sold to fine department stores from Washington, DC to New York City. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Philip Butcher, who specialized in American Literature,
            received an AB (1942) and an MA (1947) from Howard University, and in 1956 he was
            awarded a doctorate from Columbia University. From 1947 until his retirement, Butcher
            taught in the English Department of Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. He
            became a full professor in 1959, the same year that his first book, <title render="italic">George W. Cable: the Northhampton Years,</title> was published by
            Columbia University Press. Cable had been of interest to Butcher since his student days
            at Howard University and had been the topic of his Master's thesis. Butcher was married
            to Ruth Butcher with whom he had two daughters, Wendy and Laurel. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->World War II temporarily interrupted Butcher's scholarly
            trajectory and he served three years (1943-1946) in the United States Army. Although
            Butcher spent most of the war in Great Britain as an NCO in the Special Service
            Division, he did a stint at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, where the 92nd and 93rd
            Infantry--two entirely African-American Divisions--were trained. After V-E Day he was
            transferred from Britain to Germany with the 449th Signal Heavy Construction Battalion.
            Butcher, was discharged with the rank of Technical Sergeant. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Actor-playwright-director and Howard University professor
            James W. Butcher (1909-1994) was Philip's older brother. James received his
            undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois in 1932 and his Master's degree, in
            theatre, from the University of Iowa in 1941. During World War II, James, who achieved
            the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, served as a Theatre Consultant with the Special Service
            Division of the United States Army, which had been established to provide recreation and
            entertainment for the troops. His initial posting was Fort Huachuca, Arizona, but in
            1943 James was assigned to Liberia. When a German submarine sank the merchant vessel,
               <emph render="italic">Cape Decision,</emph> in which James was traveling, he and the
            other survivors drifted around the Atlantic on a life-raft for ten days before being
            rescued. His second attempt to reach Liberia was successful and James spent over two
            years, writing and directing theatre productions, along with Ossie Davis, in Monrovia. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->James taught at Howard University from 1934 to 1976, excluding
            his stints in the US Army or pursuing graduate education. For the last thirty years of
            his life he was married to Vada Easter Butcher, his third wife. He had one daughter,
            Grace Toni Jones, from his first marriage to Grace Desmond. Margaret Just Wormley was
            his second wife. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Philip and James Butcher had three sisters: Edith Harris,
            Nellie Forsyth (1904-1989) and Jennie Weir.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>The bulk of this series concerns Philip and James Butcher's service in the US Army during World War II.  A typescript copy of Philip's extensive World War II journal is here.  The material created or gathered by James Butcher includes a journal, notes and photographs of a trip from Monrovia to Dunbar Farms in the interior of Liberia; and a lifeboat log kept by H. E. Sorenson, Master of merchant vessel <emph render="italic">Cape Decision,</emph> which was torpedoed early in 1943 enroute from Charleston, SC to Dakar. James was on the <emph render="italic">Cape Decision,</emph> when it was hit and spent ten days, journeying 900 miles to safety, with Sorenson.  This series also contains US Army service handbooks and bulletins, Fort Huachuca publications and ephemera related to the variety of entertainment provided by the Special Services Division.</p>
               <p>Also included here are a few of Philip Butcher's projects and proposals.</p>
