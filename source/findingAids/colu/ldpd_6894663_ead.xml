            <p>Native New Yorker Ben Sonnenberg, Jr., is best known as the founder and editor of
                    <title render="italic">Grand Street, </title> an influential literary and
                cultural magazine based in New York City in the mid-1980s and 1990s. Sonnenberg's
                exposure to the New York literary scene began early in his life: he was the son of
                Benjamin Sonnenberg, the famous press agent who transformed the family home at 19
                Gramercy Place into a central hub for the city's business and literary circles.
                Sonnenberg both resisted and embraced his cosmopolitan upbringing, recalling his
                childhood as that of a "younger son in a family of great English furniture." In and
                out of private schools as a child, he eschewed college in favor of a rigorous
                program of reading and self-education, traveling abroad and establishing close
                relations with other writers including W.S. Merwin and Ted Hughes, both with whom he
                would correspond extensively over the next three decades. In 1963, Sonnenberg
                completed his first play, Jane Street, shortly before returning to New York to
                pursue his literary career. </p>
            <p>In 1981, Sonnenberg invested his inheritance in founding <title render="italic">Grand
                    Street,</title> a "little magazine" dedicated to literature, politics, and
                cultural criticism. Hailed in the tradition of <title render="italic">The
                Dial</title> and the <title render="italic">Partisan Review,</title>
                <title render="italic">Grand Street</title> quickly established itself as a major
                New York literary organ, with Sonnenberg hosting informal gatherings with friends
                and contributors at his apartment on Riverside Drive. As an editor, Sonnenberg was
                known for unprecedented generosity and trust in his writers, as well as his
                oft-spoken desire to enfranchise rising talent: "[I want] the money to go into their
                pockets," he frequently said of his contributors. Early contributors included
                writers like Susan Minot and Anne Carson, whose work he assiduously promoted in
                    <title render="italic">Grand Street</title> and through private foundations; the
                magazine also regularly published works by Edward Said, Arthur Danto, Grover Amen,
                James Salter, Padgett Powell, James Laughlin, Alice Munro, Edward Sorel, and others. </p>
            <p>Through the 1980s, Sonnenberg's work at <title render="italic">Grand Street</title>
                was increasingly inhibited by failing health. He was diagnosed with multiple
                sclerosis at the age of 34 and spent most of his adult life as a paraplegic,
                composing his correspondence and literary materials by dictation. Sonnenberg retired
                from the magazine in 1989; in 1991 he published his memoir, <title render="italic">Lost Property: Memoirs and Confessions of a Bad Boy,</title> a well-received
                account of his adolescence and his subsequent years abroad. Sonnenberg continues to
                write poetry and film criticism, with essays appearing in <title render="italic">Raritan,</title>
                <title render="italic">The Nation,</title> and other venues. He lives in New York
                with his wife, Dorothy Gallagher.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The majority of the collection consists of personal and professional correspondence
                between Ben Sonnenberg, Jr., <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>
                contributors, and other writers associated with the New York literary scene. The
                correspondence is primarily literary in scope, with writers often responding to
                criticism of manuscripts and works in progress, as well as providing "updates" on
                work and home life. In addition to letters from contributors, the series includes
                letters from other editors-some amicable, others less so-which provide an incisive
                portrait of the New York literary culture in the mid-1990s. </p>
            <p>Also included in the collection are administrative and financial records from <title render="italic">Grand Street</title> magazine, manuscripts of Sonnenberg's own
                work, and a small amount of family and personal correspondence. Overall, the
                material is in excellent condition, with the exception of newspaper clippings and
                magazine articles, many of which are acidic and have been either separated or
                photocopied to preserve their integrity.</p>
