         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->David N. Dinkins was born in Trenton, New Jersey on July 10,
            1927. In his early childhood, Dinkins moved with his mother to Harlem, but returned to
            Trenton to attend high school. After graduating he enrolled in Howard University in
            Washington, DC. World War II erupted and his studies were put on hold when he served in
            the United States Marine Corps. After serving as a Marine during World War II, he went
            on to obtain his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Howard University in 1950. At
            Howard, he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the nation's first
            intercollegiate fraternity for African-American men. After graduating from Howard, he
            married Joyce Burrows, a former classmate. They moved to Harlem in 1951 and in 1956 he
            graduated from Brooklyn Law School. Dinkins practiced law in New York City from 1956
            until 1975, while pursuing a career in politics. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Joyce Burrows grew up in a very political family. Her father
            was Daniel Burrows, a former assemblyman and district leader. Burrows introduced Dinkins
            to J. Raymond Jones, the "Harlem Fox", known leader of Tammany Hall, the New York
            Democratic County Organization in the 1960s. It was through Jones that Dinkins became an
            integral part of the Carver Democratic Club. During this period he mixed and aligned
            himself with an influential group of upcoming politicians that included Charles Rangel,
            Percy Sutton and Basil Paterson. Later, this group of young and ambitious politicoes
            became known as the "gang of four". </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1965, Dinkins was elected a New York State assemblyman. In
            this role he helped with the creation of the Search for Education, Elevation, and
            Knowledge Program (SEEK) in the City University of New York. SEEK assisted low income
            students with attaining a college education by helping them with basic education and
            counseling. As the program grew it became clear that many students could not stay in
            college without additional income. As a result, Dinkins mobilized the New York Urban
            Coalition and the 100 Black Men, organizations with core missions to educate youth
            through a variety of support services providing part time and summer jobs for students
            through agreements with private businesses. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Dinkins served as president of the Board of Elections from
            1972-1973, successfully establishing guidelines that facilitated and encouraged wider
            voter registration. He convinced the legislature to allow voter registration by mail in
            New York State. At the same time, he convinced corporations, community groups, schools
            and unions to make voter registration forms readily available to the public. He went on
            to serve as city clerk from 1975 until 1985. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->When Manhattan Borough President, Percy Sutton stepped down in
            1977 to run for mayor of New York City, he encouraged Dinkins to run for the vacant
            position. Dinkins lost the first election to democratic candidate Andrew Stein, but won
            on his third attempt, in the 1985 campaign. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1989 Dinkins ran for mayor, defeating three-term incumbent
            Mayor Ed Koch, for the Democratic nomination. In November, he beat republican candidate
            and United States attorney, Rudy Giuliani, winning the general election. On January 1,
            1990, Dinkins was sworn in as the first African American mayor of New York City. Dinkins
            was considered moderate and soft spoken in leadership style. When he took office, New
            York City was experiencing the effects of an economic recession; racial strife, drug use
            and crime were on the rise. Dinkins celebrated New York City as a "gorgeous mosaic"
            referring to its ethnic diversity, while pledging to mend racial tensions. And as the
            federal government had cut monetary aid to the nation's cities, Dinkins' supporters
            pushed an agenda that focused on social services for a struggling city population. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Dinkins promises to mend the city's race and religious
            divisions had to be balanced against a dire financial deficit. Nonetheless, Dinkins
            focused on making New York City a better place for its residents. He concentrated on
            AIDS prevention-treatment, fighting drug abuse, and building better schools and
            affordable housing. "Safe Streets, Safe City" was his criminal justice plan, which
            reduced crime while at the same time providing youth programs, expanding opportunities
            for children. He is credited with the creation of the office of Special Commissioner of
            Investigation for Schools, and worked to create an all civilian police complaint review
            board. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1991, a riot broke out between the Hasidic and Black
            communities in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. In its aftermath, some thought that the Hasidic
            community received favored treatment, while others thought that not enough force was
            used against the Black community. In 1993, Dinkins lost the mayoral race to Rudolph
            Giuliani. Political pundits, the day after, referred to the Crown Heights affair as
            central to his defeat. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After serving his term as New York City mayor, Dinkins
            accepted a faculty appointment in the Practice of Public Affairs at Columbia
            University's School of International and Public Affairs; he also serves on its board of
            advisors. Mr. Dinkins chairs the New York City and Johannesburg Sister City Program,
            serves on the Advisory Board of Independent News and Media, and is a member of the
            Council on Foreign Relations. He serves on the steering committee of the Association for
            a Better New York (ABNY), and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Upper
            Manhattan Empowerment Zone.</p>

                     1993. It should be noted that there is one file on Dinkins’ first electoral
                     campaign for New York State Assembly in 1965. The bulk of material consists of
                     campaign literature, fundraising events, and volunteers for the Committee for
                     David Dinkins, endorsements by constituency, speeches with drafts, candidate
                     questionnaires with responses, position papers, and strategies by groups, polls
                     and accomplishments. Also prominent are congratulatory correspondence on
                     primary and general elections. Notes of unidentified authorship can be found in
                     abundance throughout this series.</p>
