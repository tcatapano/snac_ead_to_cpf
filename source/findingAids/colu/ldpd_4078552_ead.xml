         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Publishing critical essays, commentary, reviews and original
            artwork by writers and artists such as Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, and LeRoi Jones,
            Kulchur was an important vehicle for promoting American poets and cultural critics
            associated with the New American Poetry of the mid to late twentieth century,
            particularly the New York School of poets and artists. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Kulchur Foundation, a non-profit publishing and arts
            organization, began as a small, literary journal in 1961. The magazine was founded by
            Marc Schleifer who also edited <title render="italic">Kulchur 1</title> and <title render="italic">Kulchur 2</title> before handing over administrative and editorial
            control of the magazine to Lita Hornick. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lita Hornick, who was to become the driving force behind the
            magazine and Kulchr's subsequent publishing and arts patronage activities, was born Lita
            Rothbard in 1927 in Newark, New Jersey. She graduated from Barnard College in 1948,
            where she developed her taste for modern literature and avant-garde poetry. She went on
            to do graduate work in English at Columbia University, writing her masters thesis on
            feminist novelist Dorothy Richardson, and, later, her doctoral dissertation on the work
            of Dylan Thomas. She was married to Morton Hornick and had two sons. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->When Hornick took the reigns of the magazine's third issue in
            1961 she made significant changes to the publication. The first two issues of the
            magazine had been managed by Marc Schleifer and published annually--under Hornick's
            direction the magazine focused more on arts criticism and commentary rather than
            literary publication and increased its publication schedule to quarterly. Hornick also
            established Kulchur Press, Inc. as an incorporated business in 1961 (albeit one that
            never turned a profit and was almost entirely privately funded by her and her husband). </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Though Ms. Hornick took over the administrative reigns of the
            magazine in 1961 with <title render="italic">Kulchur 3,</title> she assigned guest
            editors for the first few issues of the magazine that she published (Gilbert Sorrentino
            edited <title render="italic">Kulchur 5,</title> and Joel Oppenheimer guest-edited
               <title render="italic">Kulchur 6).</title> Starting with <title render="italic">Kulchur 7,</title> the magazine was run by Ms. Hornick as managing editor, but
            supported by an editorial board of LeRoi Jones, Gilbert Sorrentino, Frank O'Hara, Joseph
            LeSeur, and Bill Berskon. This general arrangement lasted for five issues before Hornick
            took over the sole editorship of the magazine starting with <title render="italic">Kulchur 7</title> and lasting through the magazine's final issue, <title render="italic">Kulchur 20.</title>
            </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The stress and hectic schedule of editing and publishing a
            quarterly wore on Hornick, so in 1966 she decided to alter the focus of Kulchur, Inc.
            away from periodicals and cultural commentary and towards publishing books, primarily of
            poetry. The first book published by Kulchur Press was the contemporary poetry anthology
               <title render="italic">Poems Now,</title> edited by Hettie Jones, though most
            subsequent books would veer away from the anthology format. Over the course of the
            Press's run, it published books by notable New York School poets such as Ted Berrigan,
            John Giorno, and Rochelle Owens, among a host of others. By far the venture's most
            successful book was <title render="italic">Screen Tests,</title> a book of poetry by
            Gerard Malanga accompanied by photographs of individuals taken by Andy Warhol. Hornick,
            an avid art collector, was very interested in these collaborations between visual
            artists and poets, and published a number of such volumes. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1970 the name of the organization officially changes from
            Kulchur Press to Kulchur Foundation to reflect its work as an arts funder and
            grant-giving agency as well as a publishing venture. This move also allowed the
            organization to obtain the tax exempt status available to it as a cultural foundation
            rather than a business. Though Kulchur's publishing efforts remained unchanged with this
            shift to foundation status, the foundation started to take on more cultural programming
            than it had previously, such as producing a series of poetry readings at the Museum of
            Modern Art starting in 1973 and co-producing theatrical productions. In 1981 Kulchur
            stopped publishing, though Hornick maintained foundation work in the name of Kulchur
            until her death in 2000.</p>

Most files will contain an original manuscript, and corrected and uncorrected proofs, cover art or illustrations, as well as any additional material related to the book's production or promotion such as promotional material and invitations to release parties.  This series also includes the manuscripts, proofs, and other editorial files for books written by Lita Hornick and published by Kulchur.  For files on books authored by Hornick, but not published by Kulchur, see Series III: Lita Hornick Files.  </p>
