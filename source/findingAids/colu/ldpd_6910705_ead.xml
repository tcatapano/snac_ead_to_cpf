         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->West Indian native C. L. R. (Cyril Lionel Robert) James was an
            athlete, scholar, teacher, writer and political activist. James, known affectionately
            since childhood as Nello, was born in 1901 in Tunapuna, Trinidad. His father, Robert
            Alexander James, was a schoolmaster; his mother Ida Elizabeth (Bessie) Rudder James, a
            native of Barbados, was a home-maker. James, the eldest of three siblings, had one
            sister, Olive, and a brother, Eric. In 1910, at the age of nine, James won an
            "exhibition" or scholarship to Queen's Royal College (QRC)--located in
            Port-of-Spain--which he entered in 1911. James' formal education ended in 1918 upon
            receipt of his "school certificate" from QRC.</p>
         <p>Through the 1920s James taught school, played cricket and wrote. His teaching stints
            included work at QRC where Eric Williams, future Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago,
            was among his pupils. James played cricket with the Maples, a Port-of-Spain club team,
            and was a member of the Maverick, a local literary society. In 1929 James married
            Juanita Samuel Young, a native of Venezuela who worked as a stenographer. In 1932 he
            left for Britain alone.</p>
         <p>James lived with Cricket star, Learie Constantine, and his wife Norma in Nelson,
            Lancashire, upon arriving in Britain. He picked up work as a sports writer, covering
            cricket matches, for the <title render="italic">Manchester Guardian.</title> In 1934
            James moved to London where he joined the Independent Labor Party (ILP), wrote for its
            journal, <title render="italic">New Leader,</title> and honed his skills as a speaker at
            ILP rallies. In London James met George Padmore and renewed his ties to his former
            student, Eric Williams. James also attended the founding conference of the Fourth
            International in Paris in 1938.</p>
         <p>Although James had published a few pieces in small literary journals <title render="italic">Trinidad</title> and <title render="italic">The Beacon,</title> and
            one short story, "La Divina Pastora," in <title render="italic">The Saturday Evening
               Post</title> in 1927, his career as a writer did not take off until he reached
            England. His literary accomplishments during these years included: a novel, <title render="italic">Minty Alley,</title> published in 1936; his play, <title render="italic">Toussaint L'Oueverture</title> opened in London, also in 1936,
            starring Paul Robeson; and <title render="italic">The Black Jacobins,</title> a history
            of the slave rebellion in Santo Domingo, which was led by Toussaint L'Oueverture, was
            published in 1938.</p>
         <p>In 1938, with Leon Trotsky advocating for the Socialist Workers Party's (SWP) to address
            the "Negro Question" and at the invitation of James Cannon from the American wing of the
            SWP, James left London for a speaking tour of the United States. James traveled to
            Mexico in 1939 for a meeting with Trotsky. The six-month-long cross-country tour turned
            into a fifteen-year sojourn and although James remained long in the United States, his
            time with the SWP was short. </p>
         <p>A rift among members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) led to the creation of the
            Workers Party (WP) in 1940, and within the WP, the Johnson-Forest Tendency. Johnson and
            Forest of the Tendency were James, who wrote as J.R. Johnson, and Dunayevskaya, who
            assumed the moniker of Freddie Forest. James and Dunayevskaya were soon joined in their
            political, philosophical and writing endeavors by Grace Lee, whose pseudonym was Ria
            Stone. In 1947 the Johnson-Forest Tendency rejoined the SWP briefly, but by 1951 the
            Johnson-Forest Tendency was independent of both the SWP and the WP. James and
            Dunayevskaya wrote the <title render="italic">Balance Sheet Completed,</title> to
            explain their decision to finally leave the SWP and they established the Correspondence
            Publishing Committee, which published a mimeographed newsletter, <title render="italic">Correspondence.</title> Among the members of the Correspondence Publishing Committee
            were James Boggs, who was by then the husband of Grace Lee; Freddy and Lyman Paine;
            Filomena Daddario (Finch); and Morris Goelman (William Gorman). In 1955 Raya
            Dunayevskaya left Correspondence to form the News &amp; Letters Committee. Yet
            another division occurred in 1962 when James, along with Martin Glaberman, broke with
            Correspondence to create the Facing Reality Group; James Boggs and Grace Lee Boggs, and
            Freddy and Lyman Paine remained with <title render="italic">Correspondence.</title>
            Facing Reality, whose official organ was <title render="italic">Speak Out,</title>
            disbanded in 1970. Some of the materials James wrote and collaborated on with these
            various groups included: <title render="italic">The Balance Sheet</title> (1947); <title render="italic">The Invading Socialist Society</title> (1947); <title render="italic">The Revolutionary Answer to the Negro Problem in the USA</title> (1948); <title render="italic">Notes on Dialectics</title> (1948); and <title render="italic">State
               Capitalism and World Revolution</title> (1950).</p>
         <p>During his extended stay in the United States James was based in New York City where he
            developed friendships with Richard Wright and his wife, Ellen; Chester Himes; and Ralph
            Ellison among others. </p>
         <p>In 1946 James married Constance Webb, whom he had first met during his speaking tour in
            1939 and with whom he had corresponded ever since. Due to complications around James'
            divorce from Juanita James, the marriage proved to be invalid. They re-married in 1948,
            after James spent six weeks in Nevada formalizing the divorce from his first marriage.
            (From Nevada, James wrote extensively to Dunayevskaya and Lee; these letters became the
            basis of Notes on Dialectic.) In 1949 C. L. R. James, Jr., "Nobbie", the only child of
            Webb and James, was born. James was charged with passport violations and interned, by
            the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, on Ellis Island in 1952. While
            there he wrote <title render="italic">Mariners, Renegades and Castaways</title> (1953),
            a study of Herman Melville's <title render="italic">Moby Dick.</title> In 1953, facing
            deportation, James left the United States for England; Webb remained in New York with
            their son. </p>
         <p>Brooklyn-born Selma Weinstein (sister of Correspondence member Cecelia Lang), and her
            young son Sam Weinstein, joined James in London in 1955; James and Selma Weinstein
            married in 1956. </p>
         <p>Returning to London in the mid-1950s allowed James to renew his contacts with Kwame
            Nkrumah, whom he had met in the United States in 1943, and George Padmore along with
            others involved in the Pan-African Movement. In 1957 James traveled to Ghana for the
            country's first independence celebrations, his first trip to Africa. In the 1958 James
            and Selma left London for Trinidad, where they remained until 1962. During this time
            James edited <title render="italic">The Nation,</title> the paper of the Peoples
            National Movement (PNM). In 1962, shortly before returning to London, James was severely
            injured and concussed in a car accident in Trinidad. <title render="italic">Modern
               Politics</title> (1960) and <title render="italic">Party Politics in the West
               Indies</title> (1962) were published during James' time in Trinidad. Back in Britain,
            James completed <title render="italic">Beyond a Boundary</title> (1963), a study of
            cricket. In 1965 James once again traveled to Trinidad, this time as to report on
            cricket matches for several British papers. He was promptly, albeit briefly, put under
            house arrest by the PNM-led government. Once released James helped organize the Workers
            and Farmers Party of Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
         <p>Late in the 1960s James made lecture tours of the United States, Canada and Africa. In
            1970 C.L.R. James began teaching at Federal City College in Washington, D.C. where he
            stayed most of the decade.</p>
         <p>In the last two decades of James' life several people served as his assistants, with the
            primary goal of completing the autobiography that he had begun in the 1970s. Teresa
            (Teri) Turner was his assistant for a few years in the 1970s; Jim Murray, who had been
            introduced to James by Paul Buhle, worked for James in 1983; and anthropologist Anna
            Grimshaw was James' last assistant, from late 1983 until his death in 1989. The
            autobiography was never completed. In 1984 James withdrew from public speaking, although
            he still granted some interviews. James died in 1989.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>James corresponded with a wide swath of individuals—heads-of-state and political
                  radicals; established scholars and intellectuals, and students; as well as family
                  and friends. The correspondence in this series reflects that wide-range of
                  correspondents; the number of letters exchanged with any one individual
                  represented here, however, tends to be small. The largest cache of correspondence
                  in this series is between Robert Hill and James.</p>
               <p>The topics within the correspondence are wide-ranging as well: the letters of the
                  1950s are full of references to American politics, popular culture, and the
                  writings of Melville; by the 1960s more of James' correspondence concerns
                  political movements in the West Indies and in Africa; and most of the 1970s
                  correspondence is related to teaching, invitations to conferences and requests to
                  give talks or lectures. </p>

                     radio or television broadcasts covering a range of subjects including, but not
                     limited to, literature and literary figures, history, and the Caribbean. The
                     lectures and talks are arranged by title or topic; if untitled, the pieces are
                     arranged by the organization or group to whom the talk was given. The bulk of
                     the material here consists of transcripts of the lectures, or of the recordings
                     of the lectures, and includes printed versions, carbon copies, and photocopies.
                     Two lectures by others, Frank Campbell and Rodney Walter, are here as well.</p>
