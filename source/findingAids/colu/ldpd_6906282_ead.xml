            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Albert Davis Lasker was born in Freiberg, Germany, on May
                1, 1880, but was raised in Galveston, Texas. He was the third child of Morris
                Lasker, an investor and banker, and Nettie Davis Lasker. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lasker was initially interested in journalism, and worked
                as a newspaper reporter during his teens. His father disapproved of this career, and
                in 1898 secured a position for him at Lord &amp; Thomas, an advertising firm in
                Chicago. Lasker rose quickly at Lord &amp; Thomas, becoming a partner in 1903,
                and sole owner within the next decade. He ultimately sold the firm to his partners
                and retired from active business at the end of 1942. Considered a pioneer in modern
                advertising, the firm's clients included Kotex, Lucky Strike, Pepsodent, Kleenex,
                Palmolive, Studebaker, Sunkist, RCA, and Frigidaire. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lasker's interests were not limited to the world of
                advertising. From 1916-1925, he was part owner of the Chicago Cubs. Indeed, the
                Lasker plan for the reorganization of baseball after the 1919 "Black Sox" scandal
                paved the way for the election of the sport's first commissioner in 1920. He also
                supported the University of Chicago. He donated his private golf course to the
                university, and also gave one million dollars to establish the Lasker Foundation for
                Medical Research in 1928. He served as a trustee of the university from 1937-1942. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In addition to sports and education, Lasker also had an
                interest in politics that spanned some 34 years. Although he was a Republican, he
                served in both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 1917, he served as a
                special assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture under President Woodrow Wilson. He
                served as an Assistant to the Chairman of the National Republican Committee from
                1918-1920, and worked on the campaign and election of President Warren Harding. He
                then served as the Chair of the United States Shipping Board from 1920-1923. Later,
                he was a floor leader for the Illinois delegation to the Republican National
                Convention in 1940. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Concerned with Jewish affairs on both a local and national
                level in the early 1940s, Lasker was the director of the Jewish Charities of Chicago
                and a member of the executive board of the American Jewish Committee. In memory of
                his father, who had an interest in agriculture for Jews, Lasker and other family
                members purchased farming land in Pennsylvania that allowed for the training of poor
                Jewish immigrants in agriculture. He also donated to Hadassah and other
                organizations. In 1950, he and his wife made a trip to Israel, which he described as
                the highlight of his life. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->A renowned philanthropist, Lasker founded the Albert and
                Mary Lasker Foundation with his wife in 1942, dedicated to the support of biomedical
                research for curing disease and improving human life. The foundation presents annual
                awards recognizing those who have made major advances in the understanding,
                diagnosis, treatment, cure, and prevention of human disease. The awards are
                considered to be among the most prestigious in medical science. In 1944, Lasker was
                the primary force behind a fundraising drive to increase the money spent on cancer
                research in the United States. He was also interested in federal involvement in
                medical issues, and was involved in efforts to create national health insurance and
                a national fund for medical education during the Truman administration. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lasker died of cancer on May 30, 1952, in New York City.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>Albert Lasker is best known as an advertising executive and philanthropist. His
                papers consist primarily of correspondence and subject files from the last five
                years of his life. During these years, he experienced bouts of ill health that
                forced him to restrict his activities for extended periods. His papers do document
                his interests and philanthropic work in medicine, particularly as related to cancer
                and proposals for national health insurance and a national medical education fund.
                There is also some material related to the Lasker Foundation for Medical Research at
                the University of Chicago. </p>
            <p>The collection includes a small amount of personal material, including appointment
                books, biographical information, clippings, contribution information, and mailing
                lists. </p>
            <p>There is necessarily overlap between Albert Lasker's papers and the more extensive
                papers of his wife, Mary Lasker, whom he married in 1940. Additional information on
                the couple's philanthropic work is filed with her papers.</p>
