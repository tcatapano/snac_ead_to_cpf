         <abstract>The Mike McGrady Papers contain the draft manuscripts, correspondence, memos, and
            newspaper clippings related to a publishing hoax in 1969, where 26 reporters for Newsday
            wrote a novel under the penname Penelope Ashe.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1966, three reporters, Mike McGrady, Harvey Aronson, and
            John Cummings were at a bar on Long Island discussing their opinions of recent best
            selling authors Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann. They agreed that in the literary
            climate of the 1960s, a book wouldn't sell without sex scenes, and decided that together
            they could write a bestselling "dirty book." On June 13, 1966, McGrady sent a memo to
            everyone at <title render="italic">Newsday</title> inviting them to write chapters, with
            details about the main character and a few guidelines for the writers. They were
            instructed to write chapters of at least 2,500 words, with an emphasis on sex and very
            bad writing. McGrady wrote the general storyline. The main character, Gillian Blake was
            part of a husband-and-wife talk radio team and found out her husband cheated. She
            retaliated by having an affair, and eventually escalated to breaking up all of the
            marriages in her community. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->They intended to write the entire book in a week but it
            actually took a year. McGrady and Harvey Aronson divided the editing. Once the book was
            edited, they searched for a woman to play "Penelope Ashe," and settled on McGrady's
            sister-in-law, she was the right age and appearance, and conveniently looked like
            Jacqueline Susann. The group decided on Lyle Stuart as publisher, a controversial
            publisher who had a history of controversial texts, although he had never published a
            "dirty book." Stuart knew about the hoax from the outset, and was interested in buying
            the book even without reading it. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->
                <title render="italic">Naked Came the Stranger</title> was
            published in July 1969, with a carefully chosen book jacket and photo and biography of
            "Penelope Ashe." The book was relatively successful when it first came out, and even
            though the ad campaign for the book showed photos of the actual authors, only one
            reviewer, William Trotter at the Charlotte Observer, suspected that the book wasn't
            written by Penelope Ashe. The reviews for the book were generally bad, but some
            reviewers thought that it was good for its genre. The book sold well enough that it was
            eventually issued as a paperback. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The story that it was actually written by twenty-six
            journalists eventually broke when various news organizations wanted to run the story,
            and McGrady and the others managed to turn it into front page news by playing them
            against each other. The book then shot to the top of the New York Times bestseller list,
            and the real authors promoted their work across the country. Reception to the hoax was
            mixed, but the response indicates that people thought it was a very clever ruse and
            still liked the book. A year later, McGrady wrote <title render="italic">Stranger Than
               Naked or How to Write Dirty Books for Fun &amp; Profit</title>, detailing the
            story behind the book.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>Series II contains all of the administrative files related to the hoax. McGrady
                  organized them into different groups, correspondence from the co-authors,
                  correspondence in response to the hoax, memos to the co-authors, the advertising
                  campaign, and newspapers articles describing the hoax. The correspondence from the
                  co-authors concentrates on keeping the hoax a secret after the book was published.
                  They also write about how to manage dividing the profits among 26 people, and the
                  publicity required of everyone once they were revealed. The correspondence in
                  response to the hoax contains letters from friends as well as the general public.
                  Many people wrote to McGrady after the hoax was revealed, most thought that it was
                  very clever, but there are a few letters from people who believed that the project
                  promoted this type of literature instead of criticizing it. The memos to the
                  co-authors are comprised of the original memo proposing the project, as well as
                  follow-up giving more details of the project and the expectations. This series
                  also contains a number of news clippings of the advertising as well as the stories
                  when the hoax broke, and responses to the story in various newspapers.</p>
