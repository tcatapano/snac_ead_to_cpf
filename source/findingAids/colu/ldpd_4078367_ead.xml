         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Beverly Chaney, Jr. was a traveling sales representative, or
            book traveler, for 38 years with three major publishing houses including 20 years with
            Houghton Mifflin. Chaney acted as president of the Association of Book Travelers from
            1967 and 1968. In the early 1980s, he was appointed by the Association of Book Travelers
            to compile and edit a 60 page illustrated chapbook entitled <title render="italic">The
               First Hundred Years: Association of Book Travelers: 1884-1984</title> to commemorate
            the centennial of the association. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Association of Book Travelers (or ABT) began as a
            fraternal order called the Brotherhood of Commercial Travelers in New York City in 1884.
            It is the oldest known book trade organization in the United States. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The organization underwent several name changes throughout its
            formative years. The Brotherhood of Commercial Travelers membership was open to anyone
            connected with the book trade or the stationary trade. In 1925, the ABT was founded as
            the Associated Book Travelers. Membership was restricted to publishers' male sales
            representatives. In 1940, the Brotherhood of Commercial Travelers and the Associated
            Book Travelers merged and became the Brotherhood of Associated Book Travelers.
            Membership included both 'house reps' who were salaried employees of one particular
            publishing house and 'commission reps' who were self-employed and represent a number of
            publishing houses. Historically, the ABT was an all male organization, however women
            began to join the organization in the1970s. Bebe Cole was the association's first female
            member and became its first female president in 1979 and 1980. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The commemorative chapbook entitled <title render="italic">The
               First 100 Years: Association of Book Travelers: 1884-1984</title> was compiled and
            edited by Beverly Chaney, Jr., known as Bev to his friends and colleagues, and the ABT
            historical association. It was composed, printed and bound by The Stinehour Press in
            Lunenburg, Vermont in a spcial limited edition of 750 copies. Copies were distributed to
            all ABT members in attendance at the 1984 centennial celebration at Windows on the World
            restaurant atop the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Remaining copies were also
            made available for purchase from ABT for a small sum.</p>
