         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Bowerman Collection includes three scrapbooks that narrate the early portion of
            Bowerman's professional career in librarianship.</p>
         <p>The first scrapbook chronicles the period when Bowerman went to library school at the NY
            State Library School in Albany, NY (1894-1895). Of interest in the first volume is that
            it contains a handwritten account of Bowerman's trip to the Boston area with classmates
            as well as an invitation to dine at Melvil Dewey's home (with Dewey's signature
            attached). There is also a photograph on the final page of undisclosed individuals. This
            is the only original photo included in all three scrapbooks.</p>
         <p>The second scrapbook is a collection of newspaper clippings of articles written by
            Bowerman when he was a reference librarian at the Reynolds Library in Rochester
            (1895-1896).</p>
         <p>The third scrapbook contains magazine and newspaper clippings written by Bowerman during
            the period when he was the librarian at the Wilmington Institute Free Library in
            Delaware as well as member of the Delaware State Library Commission (1901-1904). Of
            interest in this volume is a copy of the address Bowerman made to the Delaware State
            Federation of Women's Clubs (May 1901) and the First Biennial Report of the State
            Library Commission of Delaware (1901-1902).</p>
