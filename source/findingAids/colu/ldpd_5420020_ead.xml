         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Maureen Howard, born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, was the
            daughter of William Kearns, an Irish immigrant and county detective for Fairfield
            County. Howard's early novels (<title render="italic">Bridgeport Bus,</title> and <title render="italic">Before My Time</title>) draw extensively on the influence of her own
            Irish-Catholic upbringing, with Bridgeport featuring prominently in subsequent works. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Howard is best known for her novels <title render="italic">Bridgeport Bus,</title>
            <title render="italic">Natural History,</title> and <title render="italic">A Lover's
               Almanac,</title> as well as her critical introductions to Virginia Woolf and Edith
            Wharton. Her writing often describe individuals who are "out of place” often focusing on
            female characters divided between the obligations of home, career, and private life. Her
            work is frequently compared to Virginia Woolf and Henry James, both of whom she cites as
            influences. Howard was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967; her 1978 memoir <title render="italic">Facts of Life</title> won the National Book Critics Circle award. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->As a self-identified "gypsy teacher," Maureen Howard has held
            positions at Columbia, Yale, the New School for Social Research, Brooklyn College, and
            the University of California, Santa Barbara. In addition to her novels, Howard wrote an
            op-ed column "Her" in the New York Times (1979), as well as critical introductions for
            Virginia Woolf, Edith Wharton, and several collections of essays and women's fiction.
            She currently lives in New York City and teaches writing at Columbia University. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->This collection focuses primarily on her novels, beginning
            with the 1962 <title render="italic">Bridgeport Bus</title> and ending with her 2001
            collection <title render="italic">Big as Life;</title> it also includes a broad
            representation of journalism, essays, and teaching materials through this period.</p>

      <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of material for eight novels written between 1962
            and 2002, as well as her autobiography and a short play ("Songs at Twilight") published
            in 1977. Included are publisher's correspondence, drafts, edited manuscripts, and
            research notes, as well as illustration and art material for some of the later novels.
            The majority of the revisions are Howard's own; her correspondence with her publisher
            appears to be limited to minor edits and proofreading.</p>
         <p>A note on the drafts: The revisions included in this collection are often fragmented.
            Howard apparently reused her own papers, and frequently included handwritten material
            interspersed with typewritten copies or new drafts written on the back of (apparently
            abandoned) older versions. Where there is no other apparent order, the material has been
            left in the order in which it arrived.</p>
         <p>The collection also includes an extensive selection of Howard's journalism and critical
            writing, personal correspondence, and research on Howard's activism and political work.
            Overall, the material is in excellent condition, with the exception of newspaper
            clippings and magazine articles, many of which are acidic and have been either separated
            or photocopied to preserve their integrity.</p>
