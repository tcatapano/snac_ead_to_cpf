         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Bureau of Applied Social Research, headed by sociologist
            Paul Lazarsfeld, was established in 1944 and helped make Columbia a pioneering
            institution in the social sciences. Through empirical research, ideas regarding the
            functioning of individuals and groups were developed and tested. Many ground-breaking
            studies were conducted by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues, among the most important of
            which was the impact of radio and television on the American public. Through such work,
            the Bureau become the "birthplace" of mass communication research. Many survey
            techniques were developed at the Bureau, such as the focused interview and panel
            interviewing methods. The Bureau was eventually succeeded by the Center for the Social
            Sciences in 1976.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>Boxes 1-103.&amp; This Index is intended to show the entire output of each
                  Bureau project. The projects were assigned numbers that were generally
                  chronological, beginning with the year the project began, but became
                  chronologically disordered from B-1000 to B-1038 due to a transition in the
                  numbering system introduced in 1964. For these projects, the year of initiation is
                  given after the project title.</p>
               <p>Within projects, publications are listed by type: Reports, Monographs, Books,
                  Articles, Masters Essays, Doctoral Dissertations, Foreign Publications and, in a
                  few cases, Audio-Visual Materials. Within each category, publications are ordered
                  by year and then alphabetically by author. If an author produced more than one
                  publication of a given type in a particular year, a number in parentheses
                  indicates its order in that author's publications for that year.</p>
               <p>Projects that were funded through the Bureau and approved by its Board as "Bureau
                  Projects" have numbers preceded by "B." Faculty projects, for which the Bureau
                  provided space or services but that it did not initiate as an organization, are
                  indicated by an "F." Similar student projects are indicated by "S" or "D." The
                  names of the original project directors are given in parentheses after the project
                  title.</p>

                     disappear and the role in this disappearance played by radio and
                     newspaper-radio affiliations. B-0150-4 50 radio stations were selected which
                     were associated with a newspaper. 50 stations and 50 newspapers were selected
                     which were not associated or owned one by the other. Then the 50 associated and
                     non-associated stations were compared. Same was done for the 2 groups of
                     newspapers. Reports: B-0150-1 through B-0150-4 1941 Articles: Lazarsfeld 1942

                     they read newspaper ads and hear radio commercials. It also considers how
                     people are attracted to these advertisements, and the general attitudes of
                     individuals toward them. Questionnaires and sample advertisements included.
                     B-0331-2 28 women were shown a selected newspaper advertisement and questioned
                     immediately about their response to that advertisement. The respondents then
                     heard an advertisement of the same product on the phonograph in an attempt to
                     analyze what effect the use of each media has on the response to an
                     advertisement. In half the interviews the order was reversed so that the
                     respondents heard the advertisement before reading it.</p>
                  <p>B-0331-3 In addition to primary emphasis on "immediate" psychological responses
                     to the two media, this study investigates how people come to pay attention to
                     the advertisements in their newspaper and on the air and it seeks further
                     information on the attitudes people have developed toward newspaper and radio
                     advertising in general. 700 housewives interviewed. Questionnaire included.

               <scopecontent><p>[B-0361-1 This report discusses an index of public opinion leadership (a method
                     of identifying opinion leaders), the distribution of opinion leaders within the
                     Norwegian population and the degree to which opinion leaders influence others.
                     B-0361-2 Analyzing data from a survey of 2207 people in Sweden, this report
                     discusses an index of opinion leadership, the distribution of opinion leaders
                     within the Swedish population and factors influencing the likelihood of being
                     an opinion leader. B-0361-3 Since the proportion of population listening to VOA
                     broadcasts is small, this report discusses the use of the snowball technique in
                     locating a larger portion of the potential VOA audience. (The snowball
                     technique is a research method in which respondents are asked to list other
                     people they feel would make a relevant contribution to the study. These people
                     are then interviewed by the researchers and the cycle is repeated.). B-0361-4
                     This report points out problems arising from conducting international
                     broadcasting surveys involving the use of questionnaires and suggests how these
                     problems may be handled. B-0361-5 This report offers an example of a practical
                     solution to some of the problems raised in B-0361-4. It analyzes aspects of the
                     VOA's Norwegian audience, based on a sample of 557 VOA listeners and 798 other
                     listeners to U. S. radio broadcasts in 1950. B-0361-6 This paper discusses
                     problems encountered by analysts of the study, Competitive Broadcasting to
                     Germany, which was a study of the content of radio programs broadcast to
                     Germany by VOA, BBC and Radio Moscow in 1948-49. Specifically considered are
                     how the analysts dealt with problems regarding classification of content of
                     programs, presentation of data obtained and interpretation of data. B-0361-7
                     This report deals with the results of a test of VOA programs in Sweden,
                     Germany, Austria, Italy and France. In each country five specific programs were
                     tested on listener panels. The panel members filled out questionnaires before
                     and after the listening sessions to test their reactions to the programs.
                     B-0361-8 This is an analysis of organized group radio listening and the
                     structure of French radio at the end of 1949. Also includes a statement
                     outlining a long-range program of international communications research and the
                     kinds of problems which would be met whenever it was undertaken. B-0361-9 Using
                     data obtained in studies conducted in France, Austria and Finland, this
                     experiment was to provide information leading to 1) the ability to arrive at a
                     single estimate of the size of the VOA audience in each country, 2) the use of
                     a minimal number of questions to provide such an absolute figure and 3) the
                     possibility of designing a scale of intensity of listening to the VOA. Reports:

                     their attitudes toward the people, ways of life and foreign policies of the
                     four above countries. All B-0370 reports on Greece are based on the same 300
                     qualitative interviews. B-0370-2 This covers the role of radio in the lives of
                     the Greeks, including their image of radio, listening habits and preferences
                     and attitudes toward foreign broadcasts. B-0370-3 This is a comparative
                     evaluation of the three media, in an attempt to assess the relative advantages
                     and disadvantages of each of these means of communication in Greece. B-0370-4 A
                     consideration of the illiterate tavern owner who may own the only radio in a

                     qualitative interviews "designed to study the comparative role of the several
                     mass media and face-to-face communications in the lives of various segments of
                     the Turkish population." B-0370-6 115 interviews were conducted with four key
                     groups in Turkish society in order to study radio listening in general and
                     foreign broadcast listening in particular. B-0370-7 An analysis of newspaper
                     reading habits and preferences of the same four key groups, reading patterns of
                     foreign publications, and comparison of reading of American and other foreign
                     language publications. B-0370-8 This report describes their patterns of
                     moviegoing, reactions to foreign newsreels and reactions to foreign
                     documentaries. B-0370-9 The role domestic mass media played in their lives was
                     determined. B-0370-10 A survey of personal contacts among members of these key
                     groups with foreigners-domestic contacts, those abroad, and impressions of
                     Americans. B-0370-11 A study of the potential audiences within an Arab country.

                     psychological and political contexts of the communications behavior of four
                     occupational groups are studied. Based on 331 qualitative interviews. B-0370-14
                     Their communications behavior is studied in an attempt to determine the effect
                     of attitudes upon receptivity to foreign broadcasts in Egypt. B-0370-15 Based
                     on interviews with controlled sample of 300 persons. Sets up political typology

                     Middle Eastern countries, emphasizing differences related to nationality and
                     education. B-0370-19 This report brings together and codifies the implications
                     of the entire communications behavior study (B-0370) which are most relevant
                     for the International Information Administration's program in the Near and

                     bombed in World War II, this report establishes a method for estimating the
                     population loss of a city as a result of housing destruction. B-0390-2 Using
                     data obtained primarily from the local statistical office in Warsaw, this
                     report illustrates the use of demographic and transit data in analyzing the
                     growth and development of war-damaged cities. B-0390-3 This report discusses
                     the influence of wartime urban destruction on population distribution as
                     compared to the long-range historical trend in population distribution.

                     deals with further problems concerning social effects of air-borne destruction
                     in cities with emphasis on its demographic aspects. It examines the physical
                     effects of destruction on a city's transportation system, communications
                     facilities and utilities in order to determine the social repercussions of this
                     damage. B-0390-6 the social impact of bomb destruction. B-0390-7 Purpose of
                     study was "to examine existing studies and literature for techniques of
                     measuring morale, and availability of data useful for the measurement and
                     analysis of morale." B-0390-8,9 Based on statistical data, these reports

                     theoretical reflections. Merton's analysis of homophily with regard to racial
                     attitudes is presented followed by a formalization of this analysis. B-0420-4
                     This paper briefly sketches a model of a research procedure and then explores
                     in detail the general procedure followed at the last stages of an
                     investigation. B-0420-5 This is a collection of examples from the history of
                     higher education where innovations in advanced learning were proposed and
                     either adopted or defeated. The purpose was to obtain information on the
                     conditions under which new institutions become necessary, on how ideas develop
                     into concrete plans, and on the forces that aid or hinder these plans. B-0420-6
                     This discussion of panel methods for the investigation of attitudes, and other

                     classification, attribute space, and derived problems. Case material on
                     specific sociological and economic concepts and specific concepts in social
                     psychology and the measurement of change over time are also discussed. B-0420-8

                     the general position of the program in the overall organization, the methods of
                     obtaining trainees, the actual processes of training and the problems
                     uncovered. B-0420-11 Panel analysis is a research technique, a method of

                     how they may best be analyzed, by a comparative study of several areas in which

                  <p>B-0430-14 This report supersedes B-0430-13. It explores the consequences of the
                     author's assumption: "The activity of deciding which of two alternatives in
                     preferred is statistically independent of the activity of discriminating which
                     of two probabilities is larger." B-430-15 This report discusses the general
                     area of utility theory and the relationships among the various theories within
                     this area. It describes in detail the theoretical framework of Bemoullian
                     utility and discusses its applications. The overall objective of the report is
                     to present a relatively non-technical introduction to the field of Bemoullian
                     Utility theory. B-0430-16 This report discusses the major mathematical models
                     in factor analysis produced by scholars over the past half century. Taking the
                     systems in chronological order it compares and contrasts them with each other.

                     extent of attitude change and attitude reinforcement which results from
                     exposure to various media of communication, social position in the community
                     and other social factors. Based on 560 "before and after" interviews, this
                     report describes the events of the Oil Progress Week campaign and the resulting
                     impact on the attitudes of the community towards the oil industry. The report
                     focuses on changes in 10 specific opinions. B-0461-2 By applying the technique
                     of latent structure analysis, this report seeks to determine the structure of
                     attitudes toward the oil industry in order to provide a meaningful context in
                     which to study changes in these attitudes brought about by Oil Progress Week.
                     Also discussed are the relationships between opinions and attitudes. The
                     analysis is based on 10 questions asked interviewees before Oil Progress Week.
                     B-0461-3 Based on responses to the same questions as analyzed in B-0461-2, the
                     interviews for this report were conducted after Oil Progress Week instead of
                     before. Changes in the relation of general attitude to specific opinions
                     between the two interviews are studied. Some of the social groupings in which
                     favorable constellations of attitudes occur are also identified. B-0461-4 This
                     report summarizes in a briefer and less technical manner B-0461-3. Reports:

                     good children's program" are discussed. B-0482-3 The report illuminates ways in
                     which interpersonal relations operate to impede or facilitate the effects of
                     mass media and reviews some of the findings of small group research as an aid

                     are discussed. B-0482-6 This paper provides a preliminary analysis of
                     television's present performance, its potentialities and the problems involved
                     in realizing its potentialities in the area of political communication.
                     B-0482-7 The New York State Television Commission was established to study the
                     cost, methods of financing, social and economic consequences of different ways
                     to bring educational television to the public. Part I of this report presents
                     the history of the New York Television Commission based on minutes of meetings,
                     correspondence, and reports; Part II studies and appraises the major
                     assumptions underlying the cornmission's final proposals. B-0482-8 What
                     objectives organizations such as Boy Scouts, National Safety Council and YMCA
                     hope to achieve, as well as problems faced in the use of television are
                     discussed. B-0482-9 This bibliography comprises an annotated list of research
                     projects conducted on television before 1954. Its sources include all available
                     published material. The references are organized into areas of content,
                     audience, and effects. A section concentrating on children and television is
                     also included. B-0482-10 This report studies the organization and operations of
                     seven "public policy councils" or commissions selected by the Implementation
                     Committee on Television to better understand how such groups function. The
                     organizations are also compared and contrasted. B-0482-11 This final report
                     summarizes the work of the Implementation Committee and presents a history of
                     the project. Recommendations are made concerning the organization of a
                     Television Development Center. Reports: B-0482-1 through B-0482-11]</p>

                     determining the facts relevant to decision-making. The "competitive position"

                     against emotional misery, through a case study of the religio-psychiatric
                     clinic of New York City and an analysis of the literature. Report is more
                     comprehensive than resultant book, Psychiatry and Religion. B-0640-2 This
                     report concerns itself with the symbolism mediating the interaction between
                     ministers and psychiatrists. It outlines a general social theory of symbolism
                     illustrated in terms of their linguistic symbols. B-0640-3 The report sets
                     forth a theory explicating the concept of faith and provides a set of general
                     descriptive categories which may be used in the study of any situation of faith
                     and suggests hypotheses about the ways in which these categories are related to
                     each other. B-0640-3a, a precis of "Towards a Social Psychology of Faith," 18
                     pp., is bound with B-0640-4. B-0640-4 This report describes the author's trip
                     to Lourdes, first as a participant and then as an observer. Lourdes is a place
                     of pilgrimage where miraculous cures of physical ailments supposedly occur.

                     published in 113 journals in 1967-68 was rated by a national panel of 40
                     eminent researchers. Additionally, the authors of the papers were surveyed and
                     their undergraduate academic achievement, graduate training, career lines,
                     research settings, and professional rewards were analyzed in relation to the
                     quality of their research. A series of "models" was developed to explain
                     variation in quality. Published as: Quality, Careers and Training in Education
