         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Businessman, writer, and political thinker Lewis Harvie Blair
            was born in 1834 in Richmond, Virginia to Sarah Ann Eyre Heron and John G. Blair. The
            Blair family was an old and prominent Richmond family involved in numerous business and
            philanthropic concerns in the city. Blair's father was a well-known financier, and his
            father a respected reverend. </p>
         <p>Blair remained in Richmond until he was seventeen, when his father's death prompted him
            to joint the United States military. He spent four years in the service, first as a
            merchant marine and then as an engineer in the Great Lakes lighthouse service based in
            Detroit, Michigan. In 1860 Blair returned to Virginia to try to establish a career in
            business. His early career ventures were cut short by the breakout of the American Civil
            War. </p>
         <p>In 1862 Lewis Harvie Blair joined the Confederate army as a private. He remained an
            active member of the army throughout the duration of the Civil War, returning to
            Richmond after the close of the conflict. He began his career in the wholesale grocery
            business, and eventually grew to include manufacturing and selling dry goods, notably
            shoes. He also ran a successful real estate business.</p>
         <p>Blair became increasingly interested in politics and political theory, and in 1886 began
            publishing books and articles on current affairs and political themes. His first book,
               <title render="italic">Unwise Laws: a Consideration of the Operations of a Protective
               Tariff Upon Industry, Commerce, and Society,</title> was a laissez-faire economics
            text. This was quickly followed up by a series of articles he published in the <title render="italic">New York Independent,</title> and later collected and published as a
            book entitled <title render="italic">The Prosperity of the South Dependent on the
               Elevation of the Negro</title> which called for the civil equality of all men and
            asserted that the South could not prosper unless it fostered racial equality. Later in
            life he distanced himself from these views and repudiated much of his writing on racial
            equality. </p>
         <p>Blair's writing included not only a number of published texts, but other unpublished
            works including revisions of his previous work, articles, and an autobiography. </p>
         <p>Blair was married twice, first to Alice Tayles Harrison, and then to Mattie Ruffin
            Field. He had seven children with his first wife, and four with his second. He died in
            Richmond, Virginia in 1916.</p>
