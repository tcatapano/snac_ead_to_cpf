            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Herman Wouk, perhaps best known for his Pulitzer Prize winning book, <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny, </title>is a prolific author and enthusiastic supporter of Jewish culture. Wouk was born in the Bronx on May 27, 1915 to Abraham Isaac and Esther (neé Levine) Wouk, Russian Jewish immigrants. Wouk attended Townsend Harris Hall and continued his education at Columbia University, where he graduated with a B.A. with general honors in 1934. His interest in writing expanded during his collegiate years and he took advantage of the literary opportunities afforded on campus. He wrote for the <title render="italic">Spectator</title> all four years as well as the campus humor magazine, <title render="italic">The Jester, </title>becoming editor-in-chief his senior year. Wouk also made a name for himself from his popular variety shows, such as the 1932 one co-written with Arnold Auerbach entitled <title render="italic">How Revolting. </title>
            </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After graduation, Herman Wouk continued to employ his comedic skills and was a staff writer for comedian Fred Allen. However, with the onset of World War II, Wouk traveled to Washington D.C. in order to use his talent to support the war effort. He wrote promotional radio scripts for the United States Treasury Department in 1941 to entice Americans to purchase more war bonds. Wouk also began to compose other radio plays featuring soldiers and military themes. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Herman Wouk joined the United States Navy where he served on a destroyer minesweeper called the <title render="italic">U.S.S. Zane</title> in the Pacific. Wouk's free time was spent writing within a broad spectrum of genres. He penned poems praising the work of the faceless individuals involved in the war, radio and play scripts, and the beginnings of his novel, <title render="italic">Aurora Dawn, </title>published in 1946 after he was discharged. While in the Navy, Wouk married Betty Sarah Brown on December 9, 1945. They had three sons, the first of whom died in childhood. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Herman Wouk continued to produce a stream of books, articles, essays, and plays. Two years after his first novel, Wouk's second <title render="italic">The City Boy </title>was published. This was followed by <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny, </title>a book partially culled from Wouk's war experience and which became his first number one bestseller. The accolades did not stop and <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny</title> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1952. Other titles followed, <title render="italic">Marjorie Morningstar </title>(1955), <title render="italic">Youngblood Hawke </title>(1962), <title render="italic">Don't Stop the Carnival </title>(1965), <title render="italic">The Winds of War  </title>(1971), <title render="italic">War and Remembrance </title>(1978), <title render="italic">Inside, Outside </title>(1985), <title render="italic">The Hope</title> (1993), and <title render="italic">The Glory </title>(1994). Wouk has also written two studies on the history and the culture of Judaism, <title render="italic">This Is My God </title>(1959) and <title render="italic">The Will to Live On </title>(2000). </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The life of <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny </title>continued to expand for in 1954, Wouk reworked the text into a play, <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny Court Martial. </title>This production toured throughout the United States and spawned further iterations, including a televised production, a film, and a recent Broadway revival. Other books that had extended public lives were <title render="italic">The Winds of War</title> and <title render="italic">War and Remembrance.</title> Both of these novels became successful television miniseries in the 1980s. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Writing is not all that defines Herman Wouk. He is strongly committed to promoting and supporting Judaism. Wouk spent several years in the late 1950s as a visiting professor at Yeshiva University. He and his wife Betty Sarah traveled to Israel in 1955 where Wouk gave lectures, attended a performance of <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny, </title>and participated in cultural and religious ceremonies. His visit was widely covered in the press. Additionally, in the 1970s Herman Wouk endowed Beit Ephraim, a Jewish communal residence located at his alma mater, Columbia University. He continued to serve on its advisory board and, in 2002, received a Gershom Mendes Seixas Award, for outstanding contribution to Jewish life at Columbia. Herman Wouk is still writing, having published his latest novel, <title render="italic">A Hole in Texas, </title>in 2004. He lives with his wife in California.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Herman Wouk Papers span the early portion of Wouk's life, although there is some scant correspondence from the late 1990s. The bulk of the records concern his many writings in the form of articles, books, short stories, plays, and poetry. The second largest series consists of correspondence from admiring fans, colleagues, publishing houses, and family members. In addition, there are personal items, printed material, photographs, and a small amount of audiovisual material. Records documenting Herman Wouk's professional output after the 1950s are located at the Library of Congress.</p>

The series has been divided into two subseries, one that consists of articles and books and one for plays.  Both subseries contain the text itself in numerous draft forms, research material, publicity and reviews, and working notes.  In most cases, there are multiple drafts documenting Wouk’s creative process.  These drafts illustrate the progression from preliminary notes to a final piece.</p>

The manuscripts exist in multiple draft versions that are often both handwritten and typed with extensive rewrites and notes by Wouk.  These notes range from the purely theoretical to the comic and illustrate how Wouk crafted his longer writings and the ways in which he molded his ideas.  There are also several articles that Wouk wrote for a variety of journals.  Article topics range from complimentary pieces about other writers that Wouk respected, portraits of geographical locations, and issues relevant to the American Jewish community.</p>

                    <scopecontent><p>Subseries 2 is composed of plays spanning from Wouk’s time in the United States Navy all the way through the mid-1950s.  Often, the plays would go through several iterations that would include name changes.  In these cases, the final name has been retained.  The majority of the plays are comedic in nature and is concerned with topics such as human nature, art, relationships between men and women, and contemporary American society.  Some of the plays include an unmarked script as well as the director's marked script.  Set sketches, drafts of blocking for the actors, printed material, such as playbills and tickets, and background research notes are also held in this subseries.  Of interest in this subseries are several radio scripts written during the early 1940s that address the political situation and foreign policy at that time, often in a comedic way.</p>

                <scopecontent><p>Series III contains topical files such as documents relating to Wouk's work on the Adlai Stevenson presidential campaign, speeches, printed material, records from Wouk's time in the United States Navy including coursework, notes, and drawings.  There is also a small amount of personal documents in the form of newspaper articles about Wouk, records pertaining to his United States citizenship, and religious documents.  Of particular interest are two oversized posters from Israel, one advertising a 1955 performance of <title render="italic">The Caine Mutiny</title>" by the Habimah Theatre Troupe and the other a 1967 lecture given by Herman Wouk for the Hebrew Writer's Union entitled "American Jewry and Israel."</p>
