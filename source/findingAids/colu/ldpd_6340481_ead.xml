         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->An innovative journalist from print's heyday, Jason Rogers
            made his greatest contributions to the field of newspaper advertising. He was best known
            as the publisher of the <title render="italic">Globe,</title> a minor but venerable
            daily in New York City. For more than a decade, starting in 1910, he made the
            publication a success; maintaining its "clean and purposeful" reputation, while also
            multiplying circulation more than tenfold. By 1923, even competitors recognized the
               <title render="italic">Globe</title> as "the finest afternoon paper in existence."
            Nevertheless, that year he could do nothing to prevent a hostile buyout by a media
            rival. The new owner fired the staff and discontinued the paper. Neither Rogers, nor his
            career, ever fully recovered from this calamity. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->An advocate for probity and transparency, Rogers dedicated
            himself to sloughing off the advertising profession's snake-oil taint. He promised his
            clients "steady returns" rather than miraculous windfalls. "The day is gone by," he
            wrote, "when it is safe to count on a sucker being born every minute." But, it was a
            hustling age in newspapers, and Rogers himself never fully shed his striver's skin. He
            called his method "printed salesmanship," and it is difficult, at times, to
            differentiate his efforts from the sort of Barnum-esque stunts that he despised. From
            his desk at the <title render="italic">Globe,</title> Rogers inundated the industry with
            enthusiastic campaigns. Month on month, year on year, colleagues received his circulars,
            broadsides, novel ideas, stunning assertions, and confident projections. "Please Read
            This Carefully," a typical letter began, "I Think it Means Dollars in Your Pocket."
            Another offered to "Open the Door to Opportunity." A third predicted "the Biggest and
            Most Profitable Advertising Season on Record." </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Born on August 5, 1868, in Morrisania--now part of the
            Bronx--Rogers had printer's ink in his veins. His grandfather, William Cauldwell, owned
            and edited a local weekly called the <title render="italic">Sunday Mercury.</title> He
            encouraged young Jason to produce his own broadsheet, and the child took to the work,
            setting type and cranking a printing press by hand. After that experience, Rogers
            recalled, "I looked forward to the day when I should be able to work on a real
            newspaper." He did not wait patiently, but pestered his family for the freedom to launch
            his career. His parents held out until he was twelve. Then, though he had not yet
            completed grammar school, they permitted him to take a position in his grandfather's
            plant, at a salary of two dollars a week. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->"Once started at the newspaper office," he wrote, "during a
            period of fifteen years I worked in practically every department of the shop, enjoying
            every phase of activity, just because I was so keenly filled with a desire to master
            every detail and eventually rise to the top." <title render="italic">The Mercury</title>
            office was on Park Row in lower Manhattan. Also known as Newspaper Row, this street was
            the center of the publishing universe, housing such legendary enterprises as the <title render="italic">Times,</title> the <title render="italic">World,</title> and the
            Tribune. When awake, Rogers learned his business; at night he sometimes slept between
            stored newsprint rolls. On weekends, he returned to his parents' house in Morrisania. In
            1893, his grandfather promoted him to publisher of the <title render="italic">Mercury.</title> When the paper failed two years later, Rogers circulated from the
            Providence <title render="italic">News,</title> to the Chicago <title render="italic">Inter-Ocean,</title> the <title render="italic">Chicago Journal,</title> and then
            the New York <title render="italic">Sun.</title> During this apprenticeship he learned
            the trade from header to footer. "I had been through the business office from office boy
            to assistant cashier and bookkeeper," he recalled. "I had been through all the
            mechanical departments, had traveled over all outlying newspaper territory on
            circulation work, and had considerable experience in selling advertising." </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1904, he signed on as a manager at the <title render="italic">Commercial Advertiser,</title> an irrelevant evening paper in New
            York. Founded by Noah Webster in 1793, it was the oldest daily in the city. By the
            twentieth century, the journal had little but longevity to boast of. Quaint and
            old-fashioned, it could not even think to compete with the mammoths of the industry. At
            a time when the <title render="italic">World</title> claimed a circulation of 600,000
            and the <title render="italic">Journal</title> boasted an astounding 950,000, the
            Commercial Advertiser's hovered around 12,000. This changed on February 1, 1904. That
            morning, tens of thousands of New Yorkers received miniature globes in the mail. Rogers
            had transformed his old journal into the new <title render="italic">Globe.</title> He
            also halved the price, to one penny. The first issue sold 100,000 copies. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->"My boy," a mentor once confided to Rogers, "don't let the
            other fellow make your newspaper. Make your own newspaper, and as long as it is marching
            forward don't waste any time watching what the other fellows are doing." In May 1910,
            Rogers was promoted to publisher, and the <title render="italic">Globe</title> became
            his newspaper. Finally, he had the "opportunity of trying out and applying plans and
            ideas picked up in thirty years' work." His position made him a public figure, and he
            did not hesitate to weigh-in on questions of national importance. A member of the
            ocean-liner set, he traveled the world, writing home on stationery from whichever grand
            hotel at which he happened to be staying. Yet, he never lost interest in the most
            picayune questions of picas and points. On the same day, he might wire the President
            with a foreign-policy suggestion, and also rebuke a typesetter for wasting a line of
            print on the back page of the night edition. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Concerning himself with every detail of the <title render="italic">Globe's</title> production, he demanded high-minded and independent
            reporting. "A real newspaper maker," he believed, was "a man who recognizes that in his
            daily task he must be both a student and a teacher." His paper ran guides to purchasing
            pure food, offered home study courses, and printed bedtime stories for children. Rogers
            was a despot when it came to typography. A sloppy header was shabby as "a soiled white
            tie on a man.” A worn-out piece of type was “like a weather-beaten silk hat.” He wanted
            his publication to be neither garish nor fussy, but suited both to "a Bowery bar where
            the pugs study the sport stuff" and "the boudoir of the refined lady interested in the
            musical or dramatic departments." When the printers finally applied his suggestions, he
            exulted: the <title render="italic">Globe</title> is beginning to look like a real
            newspaper!” </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Perhaps Rogers's most important contribution to
            professionalizing the advertising business was his drafting of the plan for the Audit
            Bureau of Circulations, an organization that still exists. Since the nineteenth century,
            newspapers had set advertising rates based on circulation figures, but had rarely kept
            accurate--or honest--records. <title render="italic">The Sun</title> boasted on its
            masthead of "over 1,000,000" a week, but did not specify if this number referred to
            copies printed or those that actually sold. Where the <title render="italic">New York
               Times</title> displays its motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print," Joseph
            Pulitzer's <title render="italic">World</title> promised "Books Open to All." Yet there
            was no standard method of accounting, and advertisers knew they were being overcharged.
            In Rogers's first year at the <title render="italic">Globe,</title> he kept exact
            records based on copies sold. Against the advice of colleagues, he published the
            results, and challenged competitors to do the same. In 1913, he promoted a scheme for a
            national organization to objectively measure newspaper circulation. Such a group would
            take the guesswork out of setting advertising rates. A year later, the Audit Bureau of
            Circulations was founded on Rogers's principles. Today, circulation auditing is a
            universal practice. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->By 1923, the <title render="italic">Globe's</title> readership
            was well above 200,000 per day. The paper was renowned for its innovative features and
            serious reporting; it could "be counted on to take a courageous stand on all public
            questions." What's more, it was profitable. In May, however, news started spreading that
            the <title render="italic">Globe's</title> ownership wanted to sell. Several buyers
            showed interest. One was Frank Munsey, who owned the evening <title render="italic">Sun.</title> He wanted to buy out the <title render="italic">Globe</title> in order
            to eliminate a competitor. A notorious media tycoon, Munsey's critics said he lacked
            “the slightest recognition that there are such things as journalistic ideals, or public
            service, or the nobility of a great profession;” he was a “dealer in dailies--little
            else and little more.” In New York alone, he had already purchased the <title render="italic">Daily News,</title> the <title render="italic">Sun,</title> the
               <title render="italic">Press,</title> the <title render="italic">Herald,</title> the
               <title render="italic">Telegram,</title> and the <title render="italic">Daily
               Continent.</title> These, as well as many other papers and magazines, had passed
            through his control. Once in his grasp, a newspaper faced merger, decline, or demise. If
            a property disappointed him, he gave a simple order: “Kill it.” </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Rogers had no financial interest in his newspaper, and thus no
            say in its fate. "My plans are rather jumbled right now," he wrote to his son. "If
            anyone unsatisfactory to me buys the paper I will gracefully drop out." In late May,
            Munsey, the most unsatisfactory buyer possible, purchased the <title render="italic">Globe</title> for $2.3 million. He incorporated its most popular features and
            franchises into the <title render="italic">Sun,</title> and dismissed almost the entire
            staff with two weeks' pay. On the evening of June 2, solemn workers at the doomed paper
            gathered in the basement of the printing plant to watch the last edition blur through
            the presses. Everyone signed the final copy and presented it to Rogers as a gift. The
            next evening, the city paused for a moment of mourning. “Today in New York a
            considerable number of newspaper readers find themselves without a usual companion,” a
            sentimental writer noted. “An axe has once more been swung. Where once was a tree is now
            not even a stump.” </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The sale, Rogers later wrote, "was a tragedy to me and my
            co-workers." None could have suffered more than he, who had dedicated himself to the
            paper's improvement over the previous twenty years. Rogers worried for his staff, but
            tried to seem confident about his own future; "it will be a matter of weeks or months to
            catch hold again," he wrote his son. "I have no fears but one can never tell." Instead
            of taking a job at a different publication, he tried to replace what he had lost. He had
            launched many campaigns in his career, but now he organized his greatest yet. On the
            morning of June 10, 1924--almost a year to the day after his paper's demise--Rogers
            placed an ad in the <title render="italic">New York Times.</title> "Do You Want a Clean
            and Purposeful Newspaper Like the Old <title render="italic">Globe?</title>" it asked.
            He was inserting the notice to ascertain "the extent of the interest in a clean and
            uncontrolled new evening newspaper" like the one that had been destroyed. "If you want
            such a newspaper, please write to me," Rogers concluded. As a final enticement, he
            offered to let the readers themselves vote on the name for the new publication. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->At first, the venture looked promising. Letters and cards
            tided in. Rogers drafted a business plan and filed papers of incorporation. A week after
            his first ad, he ran a second notice, to the "several thousand" responders. "On behalf
            of my co-workers," he wrote, "I thank you sincerely for your interest in our effort to
            restore journalism to freedom from purely commercial domination." Soon after this, he
            announced that 12,000 people had replied to his challenge. The new paper was supposed to
            begin publication in the fall or winter. But eager responses apparently did not add up
            to interested investors. Rogers's vision of a "newspaper organized and operated by
            newspapermen of sound experience and unselfish purpose for the benefit of the people"
            was not to be. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->He was 56 years old at the time of this second disappointment,
            and would never again hold a position commensurate with the one he had lost at the
               <title render="italic">Globe.</title> From 1924 to 1926, he edited and published
               <title render="italic">Advertisers' Weekly,</title> an industry newsletter. Then he
            worked as general manager of the <title render="italic">Kansas City
               Journal-Post,</title> leaving this job after two years. Always a prolific writer,
            Rogers had authored several books on newspapers and advertising. His manuals, filled
            with peppy exhortations, were widely used in the nation's journalism schools. In his
            later life, though, he found it increasingly difficult to find publishers for his work. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Rogers had married Marian Shillaber in 1894. Their son,
            Walter, was born during 1901 in New Rochelle, New York. As a child, Rogers had
            vacationed on Cape Cod. During his time at the <title render="italic">Globe,</title> he
            had summered there with his family. In 1929, he moved to North Falmouth, Massachusetts.
            Even in retirement, he continued his advertising drives; perhaps his last, the New
            England campaign, was inspired by his new home. According to the <title render="italic">Falmouth Enterprise,</title> he was "a familiar figure on Main Street where he liked
            to drop in and chat with the merchants on their local problems." During his final
            illness, he still assembled figures and crafted plans for municipal improvements. Jason
            Rogers died on April 26, 1932. He was 63 years old.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>Jason Rogers devoted his career to promoting journalism and professionalizing newspaper
            advertising. This collection contains drafts and documents related specifically to his
            work, as well as his research on the wider industry. It includes correspondence between
            Rogers and scores of editors and publishers, advertisers, educators, and politicians
            from cities and towns around the nation. Most of these letters were generated by Rogers
            himself, who ceaselessly--relentlessly, his colleagues must have thought--shared his
            latest ideas with the rest of the profession. From Adolph Ochs at the <title render="italic">Times</title> to the business manager at the <title render="italic">Spokane Spokesman-Review,</title> no one was safe from Rogers's broadside campaigns. </p>
         <p>The collection also features documents from 1910-1923, when Rogers was the publisher of
            the <title render="italic">Globe</title> in New York City. There are editions of the
            newspaper, internal memoranda related to his formatting suggestions, as well as
            clippings concerning the publication's eventual demise. Rogers launched most of his
            largest campaigns during these years, since it was his position at the <title render="italic">Globe</title> that gave his ideas weight. </p>
         <p>Rogers was the author of several books on newspaper publishing. They were all focused on
            the same general topic--the proper way to run a profitable publication--and so it is not
            surprising that their titles have a certain uniformity: <title render="italic">Newspaper
               Building,</title>
            <title render="italic">Newspaper Making,</title>
            <title render="italic">Fundamentals of Newspaper Making,</title>
            <title render="italic">Building Newspaper Advertising,</title> etc. The collection
            includes many typescript and manuscript drafts of these, and other, works. It also
            features shorter advertising materials written by Rogers, and some correspondence with
            prospective publishers. </p>
         <p>Rogers involved himself with many of the pressing publishing issues of his era. This
            collection contains materials on some of these, including newsprint pricing, newspaper
            associations, circulations auditing, and the Pressman's Strike of 1919. It also features
            some advertising materials that Rogers himself acquired, including several advertising
            maps from the 1920s. </p>
         <p>There are some personal materials present, including family correspondence. Jason
            Rogers's son, Walter Shillaber Rogers, maintained his father's papers after his death.
            Several files contain records related to Walter Rogers's career as an engineer and naval
            officer. </p>

            <scopecontent><p>Series I contains general correspondence between Jason Rogers and his enormous
                  circle of professional colleagues. These letters from journalists, educators,
                  advertisers, and politicians mostly relate to Rogers's various campaigns to
                  improve standards in newspaper marketing. One folder features correspondence from
                  Rogers's time at the <title render="italic">Kansas City Journal-Post.</title> This
                  series also includes some family letters, mainly between Jason Rogers and his son,
                  Walter. Most of the correspondence here was filed separately in the Rogers papers.
                  There are many more letters filed chronologically throughout the collection in
                  folders directly related to specific subjects. For instance, each of Rogers's
                  advertising campaigns contains its own documents, clippings, and correspondence.

                  innovations no doubt added to his paper's reputation for creative marketing. He
                  launched each of these drives with a circular letter and some advertising
                  materials, and then reaped responses from editors around the nation. These
                  responses were then used to generate publicity for the next campaign. Rogers's
                  efforts ranged from supporting the League of Nations to fighting income-tax
                  evasion.</p>
