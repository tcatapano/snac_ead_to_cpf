         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Philip Whalen was born in Portland, Oregon in 1923 and grew up
            in The Dalles-- a small town in Oregon on the Columbia River. Whalen wrote his first
            poems while a high school student in The Dalles, but he began to write more seriously
            and identify himself as a poet while serving in the Air Force during World War II. His
            position training radio operators left him with ample down time in which to read and to
            write poetry. After the war ended, Whalen intended to pursue his interests in Asian
            literature and languages at the University of California at Berkeley, but his economic
            circumstances required moving back to his family's home in Portland. Back in Portland,
            Whalen attended Reed College on the GI Bill where he studied English and creative
            writing, and learned calligraphy from Lloyd Reynolds, a professor of art history and
            creative writing. It was also at Reed that Whalen met and befriended two other young
            poets, Lew Welch and Gary Snyder. The three lived together in a Portland rooming house
            and shared an affinity for the poems of William Carlos Williams and the rhythmic prose
            of Gertrude Stein. Though they never considered themselves part of an artistic or poetic
            movement, the three young poets would become core members of the Beat Generation and
            usher in a new style of West Coast poetry known as the San Francisco Renaissance. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Though Whalen had been studying and writing poetry throughout
            college and for several years after graduating from Reed he published infrequently
            during the first few years of his career and was known mostly among other poets in San
            Francisco and the Pacific Northwest. It wasn't until his participation in the historic
            1955 Six Gallery reading that he received national attention. The reading was organized
            to highlight the work being done by local San Francisco poets and was a major factor in
            bringing contemporary poetry, especially the work of the Beat poets, into the national
            cultural consciousness. The event, which was organized by Allen Ginsberg and hosted by
            Kenneth Rexroth, featured Whalen, Gary Snyder, Michael McClure and Philip Lamantia as
            well as Ginsberg, who read <title render="italic">Howl</title> for the first time at the
            event. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Whalen's fame grew after the Six Gallery reading and he sold
            several poems to significant literary journals such as the <title render="italic">Evergreen Review</title> before the publication of two major book of poems in 1960,
               <title render="italic">Memoirs of an Interglacial Age</title> and <title render="italic">Like I Say.</title> The momentum around the west coast beats that
            started picking up after the Six Gallery reading continued and became codified with the
            publication of Don Allen's anthology <title render="italic">The New American Poetry,
               1945-1960</title> by the Grove Press. This anthology featured a number of emerging
            poets and served as a virtual who's who of contemporary poetry, including Whalen, who
            contributed several poems to the volume. Whalen continued to publish regularly
            collections of poetry such as <title render="italic">On Bear's Head: Selected
               Poems,</title>
            <title render="italic">Severance Pay: Poems 1967-1969,</title>
            <title render="italic">The Kindness of Strangers: Poems, 1969-1974</title> through the
            1990s. He also wrote three novels- a loose trilogy comprised of <title render="italic">Imaginary Speeches for a Brazen Head,</title>
            <title render="italic">You Didn't Even Try,</title> and <title render="italic">The
               Diamond Noodle.</title>
         </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In addition to being a poet, Whalen was also a devout
            Buddhist. He studied meditative practices and lived in Kyoto Japan in 1966 and 1967
            writing immersing himself in Zen Buddhist practices. He was ordained at Zen Buddist
            priest in 1973 and rechristened Zenshin Ryufu, which means "Zen-mind-dragon-wind." He
            spent most of the later years of his life living in Zen Centers and monasteries,
            including a role as the abbot of a monastery in Santa Fe, New Mexico and at the Hartford
            Street Zen Center in San Francisco where he acted as abbot for the center and its
            associated AIDS hospice. He retired from his work as an active priest in 1996, but
            continued to write and publish poetry throughout the 1990s. </p>
