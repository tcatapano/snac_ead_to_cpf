         <abstract>The papers of the Bonsall Family of Pennsylvania primarily consist of
            correspondence, personal and professional documents, journals, genealogical tables,
            photographs, and a family Bible. The majority of the letters, documents, and journals
            were generated by or for Edward H. Bonsall (1794-1879) and the members of his immediate
            family, particularly his eldest son, Spencer Bonsall (1816-1888). Also included are
            documents produced by or for other Bonsall family members, from Richard Bonsall who
            settled in Philadelphia with William Penn (ca. 1683) to Eleanor Crosby Martin Bonsall
            (1894-?), the daughter of William Martin Bonsall and granddaughter of Spencer
            Bonsall.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The Bonsall family traces its North American ancestry back to
            Richard Bonsall (d. 1699), who left England with William Penn around the year 1683 to
            settle in Pennsylvania. Over the course of their history, the Bonsalls remained devoted
            members of the Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers. Well into the
            nineteenth century, much of their correspondence retained the use of "thee" and "thou"
            that were characteristic of Quaker plain speech, while months and days usually appeared
            in numeric rather than named form (for example, "1st month, 4th day= January 4") to
            disassociate them from pagan deities. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth
            centuries, most of the Bonsalls continued to reside in the Delaware Valley, especially
            in the areas surrounding Philadelphia, Germantown, and Chester, but, as the country
            began to expand westward, others moved out to Ohio, Illinois, and Colorado. The Bonsall
            heirs were chiefly occupied by real estate, transportation, surveying, and the law, from
            which they seem to have derived a comfortable, if not extravagant, living. A great part
            of the material in the collection concerns Edward H. Bonsall (1794-1879) and his oldest
            son, Spencer Bonsall (1816-1888). The family of Spencer's wife, Ellen Crosby Martin, is
            also well represented. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Edward H. Bonsall (1794-1879): Edward H. Bonsall was born in
            1794 to Isaac Bonsall (1765-1831) and Mercy Milhous (1768-1805) of Philadelphia. His
            career as a conveyancer engaged him in the founding of the Philadelphia, Germantown and
            Norristown Railroad, of which he eventually became president. In addition to being an
            avid writer of letters, speeches, and poems, Bonsall was an active member of several
            learned and charitable organizations, including the Philadelphia Literary Association
            and the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons. As revealed in a number
            of his writings, he also nurtured a lifelong interest in travel. His detailed travel
            notes record the history, surroundings, and landscape of various cities in Europe,
            Egypt, and a burgeoning industrial America. These accounts frequently incorporate
            records of his day-to-day travel arrangements and expenses. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Spencer Bonsall (1816-1888): Spencer Bonsall, the first son of
            Edward H. Bonsall and Lydia McIlvain (1795-1854), inherited his father's love for travel
            and history. He was educated at the Quaker Westtown Boarding School in Chester,
            Pennsylvania, where, as his correspondence reveals, he lived an active social life.
            After an apprenticeship to the druggist Samuel C. Sheppard, Spencer took a trip around
            the world, passing through Madeira, Portugal, and landing in Calcutta, India. In 1840,
            he returned to India where he secured a position with the Assam Tea Company. Upon his
            return to the United States eight years later, he became the principal surveyor for the
            city of Philadelphia, and shortly thereafter, in 1854, married Ellen Crosby Martin. Upon
            the outbreak of the Civil War, Spencer enlisted in the 81st Pennsylvania infantry as a
            hospital steward, where he served from 1861 until 1863 when he was slightly wounded at
            the Battle of Gettysburg. From 1869 to 1883 he served as an assistant librarian and
            genealogist at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</p>

                <scopecontent><p>This series, which comprises approximately half of the collection, contains correspondence by and to various members of the Bonsall and Martin families.  Most of the letters were generated by or to Edward H. Bonsall (1794-1879) and are personal in nature, although a small number concern Bonsall's career as a conveyancer and railroad industrialist.  Substantial correspondence exists between Edward H. Bonsall and his son, Joseph Bonsall (1833-1876); and between Edward H. Bonsall and John Ousley Bonsall, a distant relative living in Ireland. The collection also contains several letters written by or to Spencer Bonsall when he was a student at the Westtown School in Chester, Pennsylvania. The Martin family is represented by several letters between William Martin, Esq. (1797-1862); his wife, Sarah Ann Martin (née Smith); and their daughter, Ellen Crosby Martin, wife of Spencer Bonsall. </p>

                <scopecontent><p>This series, which comprises most of the remainder of the collection, contains a broad range of documents relating to several generations of the Bonsall family.  The largest portion consists of ancestral wills, land deeds, and other property records, dating from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries.  Also well represented are genealogical tables and coats of arms.  Personal documents, such as poems, calling cards, tickets, and invitations, are interspersed with professional membership certificates, speeches, writings, and general memoranda.  Dozens of photographs, tintypes, and silhouettes depict members of the Bonsall and Martin families, some of which have been annotated by William Martin Bonsall, the son of Spencer Bonsall and Ellen Crosby Martin.  A small number of documents pertain to individuals with an uncertain relationship to the Bonsall family, while a few others are anonymous.  A map of the Denver, Colorado area by Joseph H. Bonsall, dated August 22, 1871, has been moved to the Historical Map Collection.</p>

Bonsall (1794-1879) and Spencer Bonsall, which describe voyages to Washington DC, the Ohio Valley, and Calcutta, India.  The collection also contains a Civil War journal by Spencer Bonsall, written between March 1 and April 17, 1863 during his service as a hospital steward in the 81st Pennsylvania Regiment.  Further additions include a book of genealogical tables, the legal journal of John Crosby (written between 1803 and 1816), and a handful of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century account books containing the costs for such mundane expenses as rent, hair dressing, and laundry. The collection also contains the composition books of Spencer Bonsall, his mother, Lydia McIlvain, and a Rebecca B. Thomson, whose connection to the family is unclear.</p>
