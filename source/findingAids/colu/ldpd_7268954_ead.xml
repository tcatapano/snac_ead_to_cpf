         <abstract>A collection of over 5,000 true short stories written as submissions for National
            Public Radio's (NPR) National Story Project, which was a segment on Weekend All Things
            Considered. The National Story Project was created and supervised by American author,
            Paul Auster.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The National Story project began in 1999 after American
            author, Paul Auster, read a selection from his novel <title render="italic">Timbuktu</title> on NPR's Weekend All Things Considered. Auster was asked to return
            to the program by its then host, Daniel Zwerdling, to perform another reading at a
            future date. Auster answered with the conditional response that he would be willing to
            return, but only if he could read other people's stories and not just his own. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The National Story Project began taking submissions from
            listeners in 1999 October through both e-mail and mail. The guidelines for the stories
            were that they had to be no more than three pages in length and that the submissions
            relayed a true event. The selected stories would then be edited or rewritten, if needed,
            by Auster and his team. The National Story Project aired on Weekend All Things
            Considered the first Saturday of each month from 1999 November until 2001 July and
            during that time received over 5,000 submissions from all over the United States on a
            wide variety of topics and from people of varying ages, gender and backgrounds. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After the National Story Project ended, Auster selected his
            favorite submissions and compiled them for a book entitled <title render="italic">I
               Thought My Father Was God: And Other True Tales from NPR's National Story
               Project.</title> The collection was published in 2002 by Picador, a Macmillan
            Publishing imprint.</p>

         <p>This collection contains over 5,000 submissions to the National Story Project, a program
            that aired from 1999 November until 2001 July on National Public Radio's Weekend All
            Things Considered. The collection primarily contains printed e-mail submissions and
            letters received through the mail. In addition to the stories, some participants sent
            cassette tapes or CDs of themselves reading their stories or performing music to
            accompany the submission. Also included are books, photographs, newspapers, magazines,
            pamphlets and other materials either meant to verify their submission as true, add
            context to their submission, or to show other formats that their submissions had
            appeared in previously.</p>
