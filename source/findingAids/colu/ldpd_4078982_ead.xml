         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Jack Kerouac, born Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac, was born in
            1922 in Lowell, Massachusetts to French Canadian parents. Kerouac spent much of his
            youth engaged in sports and other physical activities. His athletic prowess earned him a
            football scholarship to Columbia University where he matriculated in 1940, but he left
            Columbia in the Fall of 1941 after sustaining an injury that left him unable to play
            football. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Upon leaving the University Kerouac joined the Merchant Marine
            and later the US Navy, but retained close ties to members of the Columbia community. He
            lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side with his girlfriend, later first wife, Barnard
            student Edie Parker and her friend Joan Vollmer. It was through Parker that Kerouac met
            Columbia students Allen Ginsberg and Lucien Carr and their friends William Burroughs and
            Herbert Huncke. This group of friends and writers which would later form the nucleus of
            the Beat Generation, was the inspiration for much of Kerouac's work. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Kerouac married Edie Parker in 1944 and moved with her to her
            home in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, but their marriage lasted less than a year. Upon the
            annulment of the marriage, Kerouac returned to New York and his bohemian friends and
            began to write the novel which would become <title render="italic">The Town and the
               City</title>-- this novel, Kerouac's first, was published in 1950 to mild acclaim. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Kerouac's next novel, <title render="italic">On the
               Road</title> proved to be much more commercially and critically successful. This
            novel, published in 1957 documents a trip Kerouac took across the US and Northern Mexico
            with Neal Cassady. This fictionalized account of Kerouac and his friends introduced the
            beats to America solidified the image of the beatnik with his interest in sexual
            freedom, jazz, and drug use in the popular imagination. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Though Kerouac's goal had long been to be a writer, the
            success of <title render="italic">On the Road</title> never sat entirely well with its
            author. Kerouac continued to write his thinly veiled autobiographical novels chronicling
            his bohemian, literary circle of friends, but in his personal life he began to pull away
            from the public eye and distance himself from his Beat Generation associated. He moved
            to Northport, Long Island to care for his aging parents and growing more personally and
            politically conservative. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Kerouac died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1969. </p>
