         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Frank Altschul was born in San Francisco on April 21, 1887 to
            Charles and Camilla Mandlebaum Altschul. Charles, a partner in the investment firm
            Lazard Frares, brought his family to New York City in 1901 to work at the company's New
            York office. Frank Altschul studied at Yale University, graduating with a Bachelor of
            Arts degree in 1908. Following commencement, he traveled for two years, studying banking
            in London, Paris, Berlin, and Mexico City. During World War I, he served as an Army
            captain in France and was awarded the Legion of Honor. He married Helen Lehman Goodhart
            in 1913, and the couple would have four children. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Altschul proved to be a highly successful financier and became
            a senior partner at Lazard Freres in 1943. In 1948, he became chairman of the board of
            the General American Investors Corporation, where he remained until his retirement in
            1961. During the 1930's, Altschul also served on the governing committee of the New York
            Stock Exchange and was director of the Chase National Bank. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Altschul applied his skill in running large organizations to a
            variety of causes, particularly political and advocacy organizations. He served as
            Director of the English-Speaking Union and vice president of the Woodrow Wilson
            Foundation and was heavily involved in the Council on Foreign Relations for almost four
            decades, serving as secretary and later as vice president from 1951 to 1971. Altschul's
            interest in interntional affairs was also present in his writing. A prolific writer of
            essays, articles, and book reviews, as well as a book, <title render="italic">Let No Wave Engulf Us</title> (1944). He
            frequently wrote letters to the editors of major newspapers, particularly the New York
            Times. Altschul was invited to speak before groups ranging from political and business
            committees to high school classes, and gave talks on psychological warfare, US relations
            with Israel, and many other subjects. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->A self-described bibliophile, Altschul was an avid collector
            of books and possessed a lifelong fascination with printing. He was the co-founder and
            first chairman of the Yale Library Associates, which oversees the Yale Library System
            the Beineke Library. He established an endowment and donated much of his own collection
            to the Bienecke, including an extensive collection of the works and papers of George
            Meredith. In 1933, Altschul founded Overbrook Press on his estate in Stamford,
            Connecticut and began producing a wide variety of books, pamphlets, and ephemera. The
            press was highly regarded for its craftsmanship and innovative design work, and
            Overbrook volumes were consistently included in the ''Fifty Books of the Year'' show of
            the American Institute of Graphic Arts. Overbrook Press was dissolved in 1969. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Altschul was a philanthropist and supporter of education and
            the arts, endowing chairs and fellowships at Yale, Williams College, the Mount Sinai
            School of Medicine and the New School for Social Research. He also gave generously to
            hospitals and charities. His wife Helen shared his interest in education, serving on the
            board of trustees Barnard College and funding a chair in English. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Frank Altschul died on May 29, 1981.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The collection documents Altschul's personal life and his ventures into publishing,
            politics, and international affairs. It contains little material directly related to his
            banking career. The bulk of the files contain correspondence, drafts and discussions of
            Altschul's writings; administrative files from his positions in various organizations;
            and pamphlets, articles and brochures on subjects which interested him. It also holds
            smaller amounts of photographs and memorabilia, as well as writings and notes by his
            father, Charles Altschul, and other family members and associates.</p>

                     personal life and the many activities he pursued outside of his banking career.
                     It includes discussions with scientists, historians, and others about political
                     events and theories, conversations with editors about article drafts and
                     reviews, congratulatory notes and holiday cards, and intimate letters between
                     friends and family members. Files include both incoming correspondence and
                     copies of outgoing letters by Altschul and his secretary. They are arranged
                     alphabetically, with some further division by document type. </p>

            <scopecontent><p>This series contains the papers of Frank Altschul's parents, Charles and Camilla
                  Altschul. Though his family was American, Charles was born in England and studied
                  Germany, and he retained a strong interest in European politics and history
                  throughout his life. His papers contain research notes, annotated subject files
                  and correspondence on many topics, including European economics, social issues
                  such as health care and birth control, and research on foreign language
                  publications in the United States. Several files hold correspondence and articles
                  written in response to his writings, including his monograph "The American
                  Revolution in Our School Textbooks" and articles on war debt and war guilt after
                  World War I. The series also holds correspondence between Charles Altschul and his
                  cousin, Dr. Paul Hammerschlag of Vienna. The series contains smaller amounts of
                  information on other members of the Altschul family, such a family tree, a
                  marriage scrapbook for Frank Altschul's uncle and aunt, William and Rosita
                  Altschul, Rosita's diary, and an art history notebook kept by Maria Altschul.
                  Information on Camilla is limited to condolences upon her death in 1952. </p>

                  draft or copy of the finished piece, as well as notes and related correspondence
                  and articles. There are also several files concerning the publication of "A
                  Catalogue of the Altschul Collection of George Meredith in the Yale University
                  Library" and biographical articles about Altschul. Files have been divided by
                  document type and further arranged alphabetically by title. The series also holds
                  a small number of speech drafts by Altschul's acquaintances, including Raymond
                  Buell, Arther L. Goodhart, and playwright Clare Boothe Luce, which can be found

               <scopecontent><p>This eclectic subseries contains files on a wide range of subjects that were of
                     interest to Altschul, ranging from chess and stamps to disarmament and Judaism.
                     Some files contain clippings and general information on a subject, while others
                     relate more directly to Altschul's personal activity; under "books," for
                     example, there is information about Altschul's private collection, including
                     correspondence regarding book purchases, collection lists, and invitations to
                     book club events and author luncheons. The series also contains Altschul's
                     address books and biographical information collected for his entry in <title render="italic">Who's Who
                     in Commerce and Industry</title>. Files are arranged alphabetically. </p>

               <scopecontent><p>This subseries documents Altschul's political activity. Correspondence files
                     contain his letters to U.S. senators, representatives, and other political
                     figures, as well as their responses. Campaign files consist primarily of
                     correspondence between Altschul and other supporters and discuss the progress
                     of his favored candidates and the distribution of pamphlets and articles on
                     their behalf. Both correspondence and campaign files are arranged
                     alphabetically by politician name. The subseries also holds smaller groups of
                     files relating to Altschul's campaign contributions, his participation in
                     several Republican campaign drives, and subject files on voting issues,
                     particularly black voter turnout in the 1930s and 1940s. </p>

            <scopecontent><p>This series contains a collection of article reprints, fliers, brochures, and
                  ephemera relating to Altschul's many interests, particularly social and political
                  issues such as patriotism, Communism, human rights, and education. Some represent
                  the views of individuals, while others were printed by organizations such as the
                  Friends of Democracy and the Foreign Policy Association. Documents are filed
                  alphabetically by author or organization name and occasionally by subject. This
                  series also holds one box of sampled clippings from Altschul's clipping file,
                  representing the type of material he collected from major newspapers. </p>
