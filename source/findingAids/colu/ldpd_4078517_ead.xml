         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Edith Louise Altschul was born in San Francisco on August 8,
            1889 to Charles and Camilla Altschul. Charles, a successful banker with Lazard Freres,
            moved the family to New York City in 1901. Edith attended Dr. Sach's Girls School and
            Miss Jacoby's School (now the Calhoun School) and took a nursing course after
            graduation. She met Herbert H. Lehman, a partner in the Lehman Brothers investment firm,
            at a picnic. They were married on April 28, 1910 and would have three children, Peter,
            John, and Hilda. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Edith considered her marriage her career and the most
            important aspect of her life, but she was also deeply involved in social welfare and
            philanthropy. She organized a social service committee to care for the family needs of
            hospitalized patients. This endeavor led to the creation of Mount Sinai Hospital's first
            professional social service department, and she remained closely associated with the
            hospital for many years thereafter. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Lehman was also involved with the Henry Street Settlement,
            which provided health care and other assistance to new immigrants and the poor living in
            the Lower East Side of New York City. In 1948 the Lehman's built Pete's House, a youth
            center at Henry Street Settlement dedicated to the memory of their son Peter, who was
            killed in World War II. Peter had volunteered as a youth leader at the Settlement. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1917, Edith Lehman became a charter member of the Play
            Schools Association, which promoted play as vital to the mental and physical health of
            children. The organization partnered with schools, hospitals, and other institutions to
            provide opportunities for creative play. Lehman would work with the organization for
            over fifty years, serving as president and as Chairman of the Board from 1966 until her
            death in 1976. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Edith Lehman was also involved in the Jewish communities of
            New York and a member of the American Jewish Committee and the Federation of Jewish
            Philanthropies, among other organizations. She was a supporter of Israel, and first
            visited the country in 1949 with her husband. The Edith Lehman High School in Dimona,
            Israel, was dedicated to her. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1961, the Lehman's built the Lehman Children's Zoo (now the
            Tisch Zoo) in New York City's Central Park in honor of their 50th wedding anniversary.
            Although the zoo was renovated in 1997, the bronze Lehman Gates still stand at the
            entrance. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After her husband's death in 1963, Edith Lehman established
            several major endowments and institutions in his honor, including contributions to Mount
            Sinai Hospital Medical School and the establishment of the Lehman Professorship in
            Pediatrics at that institution; the Lehman Educational Fund, which offers scholarships
            for African American college students; and the Lehman School of Ethics at the Jewish
            Theological Seminary. She also supported Williams College, Herbert Lehman's alma mater,
            and financed and endowed the Lehman Suite at Columbia University's School of
            International and Political Affairs. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In recognition for her dedication to social causes, Edith
            Lehman was awarded honorary doctor of humane letters degrees from Williams College and
            Mount Sinai School of Medicine, as well as a doctor of laws from Columbia University. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Edith Altschul Lehman died on March 8, 1976, in New York City.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>This series holds a variety of notebooks, awards, artifacts, and other objects
                  representing many aspects of Edith Lehman's life. It includes elaborately bound
                  scrapbooks and other gifts from her uncle, Richard Altschul, which he made each
                  year for his niece's birthday. Consisting of family traditions and injokes, they
                  were known as "The Richy Classics." The series also houses family documents, the
                  diaries, and several photo albums documenting wedding anniversaries and trips.
                  Other albums cover events such as the dedication of Herbert Lehman College and the
                  construction of Pete’s House; most of these were given to the Lehman's as
                  commemorative gifts. The series contains a watercolor painting of the Lehman
                  Children's Zoo and two original sketches of the zoo's animal sculptures, designed
                  by artist Aymar Embury. Also included are social books, Christmas gift lists,
                  diplomas and membership certificates, and awards, medals, pins, statues, and other
                  items given to Edith in recognition of her philanthropic activities. </p>
