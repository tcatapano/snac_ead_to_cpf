         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Enid Algerine Bagnold was born in October 1889 in Rochester, Kent, England. Both a
            novelist and a playwright, Bagnold is best remembered for her 1935 book, <title render="italic">National Velvet, </title>which was made into the 1944 film of the
            same title starring Elizabeth Taylor. Her writing career began much earlier, however,
            when she wrote candidly about serving as a nurse and then as a driver during World War
            I.</p>
         <p>In 1920, Bagnold married Sir Roderick Jones, earning the title Lady Jones yet
            maintaining her maiden name for her writing career. They resided in the Sir Edward Burne
            Jones House in Rottingdean, Sussex, England. The couple had four children.</p>
         <p>Throughout her long career, Bagnold befriended many in the literary world, some of whom
            are included in her 1980 publication, <title render="italic">Letters to Frank Harris
               &amp; Other Friends. </title> Another such friend, nephew of writer William
            Somerset Maugham, Robin Maugham was especially important to her in the final years of
            her life. Bagnold died in March 1981 at the age of 91.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>Enid Bagnold's letters to Robin Maugham are primarily personal in nature, though it is
            evident that Maugham often sent Bagnold copies of his books for which, whether solicited
            or not, she would share her critique. The letters begin in 1963 with a short,
            hand-written note on Bagnold's personalized stationery. The letters throughout the 1960s
            and 1970s, many of which are also hand-written on this stationery, are often
            congratulatory and consist primarily of discussions of the two's work and travels.
            Katharine Hepburn is mentioned in one. </p>
         <p>Some of the letters in the "undated" folder are fragments. Only one of the letters
            includes a response from Maugham.</p>
