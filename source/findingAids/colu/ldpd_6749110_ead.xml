            His early training was as a musicologist in Tours, France specializing in Gregorian
            Chant. He studied psychology, specializing in the effects of music on the mentally

            becoming totally blind by 1947. During his blindness he wrote his two major novels The
            Devil Rides Outside and Nuni as well as numerous short stories. In 1951 he became a
            Roman Catholic. After recovering his sight in 1957, he wrote for Sepia magazine and in
            1959 he wrote a series of articles for Sepia magazine based on his travels through the
            Deep South as a "black" man. This series was published as Black Like Me in 1961. </p>

               <scopecontent><p> [The first draft of Griffin's first novel. Sent as a gift to Sally Gillespie.
                     In reading the manuscript it becomes obvious that the news stories surrounding
                     the novel's composition--stories which were promulgated by the Smith brothers
                     who owned Smiths, Inc. of Fort Worth--were inaccurate: Griffin did not write a
                     900 plus page manuscript which was cut nearly one-third by the editor/publisher
                     Gordon Smith; the novel did not begin as a non-fiction account of Griffin's
                     experience at the Abbey of Solemes, the Benedictine motherhouse of Gregorian
                     Chant.. The novel varies from the final Smiths published version in relatively
                     minor ways. It does not open with the scene of the anonymous American
                     musicologist being driven to the old monastery by the cab driver, but begins
                     with the narrator in his monastic cell (which is the second scene of the
                     published version). The original manuscript has a short Epilogue which was
                     dropped from the published book. That Epilogue was Part III, whereas the book
                     has only two parts, entitled ."The Cloister Within" and "The Devil Without".
                     The original manuscript simply calls these first two parts, "The Monastery"
                     and. "The Village." Otherwise, the manuscript runs closely to the published
                     book. This does not indicate Griffin made several complete drafts from this
                     1947 first draft to the galley stage, in 1951. (The novel was published in
                     1952). It indicates that some sections were added later and some cutting was
                     done from the original manuscript. The massive, poorly-written,
                     obscenity-riddled typescript of 900 pages is a fiction of the publisher. Also,
                     the press releases from The Smiths which referred to Griffin's blindness and
                     his war heroics were considered in bad taste by the author. He preferred to use
                     a pseudonym which he had used (several in fact) when he submitted magazines
                     work. Several pieces were published under the name Lew Smollett and no mention
                     of the author's blindness or war experiences were included. Griffin discusses
                     these times in his letters to Sally Gillespie (see Series VII)</p>

                     translated various other French texts. Few were published but he made these
                     translations as much to keep himself bilingual and for the intrinsic value of
                     what he translated. During this period he was also receiving tapes, in both
                     English and French, from Jacques Maritain, Father Stanley Murphy, and Gerald
                     Vann, the British Dominican scholar. He considered it all part of his
                     continuing classical education in language, in philosophy, and in theology. He
                     speaks also of translating some of Albert Camus' novel <title render="italic">The Stranger</title> into English, but none of those pages have been found.

               <scopecontent><p> [This is a piece written about the Benedictine monastery located between
                     Mexico City and Cuernavaca . One of Griffin's abiding passions was the study of
                     the monastic life. In the case of this piece, he did hope to publish it but was
                     not successful. Nonetheless, in writing it, he was consistent in his ongoing
                     interest in monasticism. Several of his short stories of this period are about
                     characters in monasteries--both serious, like "Metamorphosis" and comic, like
                     the Friar Clud stories. His first novel, <title render="italic">The Devil Rides
                        Outside</title>, takes place in part in a monastery. Relating in general to
                     this passion for the monastic life are his lectures on Gregorian Chant,
                     combining the roots of monasticism with the flower of medieval music.</p>

               <scopecontent><p> Concerning Griffin's novels, <title render="italic">The Street of the Seven
                        Angels</title> and <title render="italic">Passacaglia</title>, it is
                     necessary to outline the genesis of his creative process as regards these works
                     begun in the mid-1950s. . Initially, all of this material was intended for one
                     large novel, tentatively entitled "Point, Counterpoint," but when Griffin heard
                     that Huxley had published a novel with that title, he began to rethink his
                     concept. His journals indicate that the large novel was really made up of
                     alternating chapters with two sets of characters (although a few characters
                     cross from one story to the other). One, which became <title render="italic">Street</title>, focused on the character of Chez Durand, a bookshop owner,
                     who becomes involved in an obscenity trial; this story features a large cast of
                     characters and is comic in intent. The second novel, <title render="italic">Passacaglia</title>, is a serious work about a concert pianist and his
                     illegitimate son--also a pianist. . The manuscript herein called <title render="italic">Passacaolia</title> is actually the remnants of the larger
                     novel (207 pages of typescript carbon) which was never completed. The
                     manuscript of <title render="italic">Street of the Seven Angels</title> is a
                     221 page typescript, an original he revised from portions of the carbon, from
                     1966-1972. He intended to publish <title render="italic">Street</title> as his
                     third novel and even though he came under contract with Houghton Mifflin for
                     the work, it was never published. He never returned to do a revision of <title render="italic">Passacaglia</title>. A reading of <title render="italic">Street</title> will reveal that it has been revised and completed, but a
                     reading of the carbon of <title render="italic">Passacaolia</title>--which has
                     gaps in pagination, as well as many adjustments (as many as five changes on
                     some pages)--never received any revision.</p>

                     (Chapter I of the manuscript) was cut by one-third for the published book. This

                     "The Frontier Fights West" (Chapter 2 of the manuscript) was divided into four
                     chapters in the book: "Comanche Country" (2), "Frontiersmen Move West" (3),
                     "Struggle to Survive" (4), and "Cattle Country" (5). . "Windmill Town" (Chapter
                     3 of the manuscript) became Chapter 6 of the book--without any major changes,
                     except that the final 22 mss. pages became Chapter 7 ("Cowboy") in the
                     published version. This chapter about cowboys was reprinted in <title render="italic">The Reader</title>. . "The Love Letters of Bessie Love"
                     (pages 228-249 of the manuscript) was cut from the published book. That chapter
                     was published for the first time in <title render="italic">The John Howard

                     and maintained their original titles. . "The Impossible" (Chapter 6 of the

                     Irving has two books of literary criticism. As a team, they published their
                     most important books: <title render="italic">How To Read A Dirty Book</title>,
                     which discusses both the censorship trials of <title render="italic">The Devil
                        Rides Outside</title> and <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title>;
                        <title render="italic">Profiles in Hope</title>, which has a chapter on
                     Griffin; and their biography of Thomas Merton, published by MacMillan,
                     featuring a Griffin photographic portrait of the monk as its cover. . Griffin
                     considered the Sussmans part of his adopted literary family because they were
                     contemporaries who were conversant with his own spiritual influences: Jacques
                     and Raissa Maritain, Thomas Merton, Robert and Gaby Casadesus, as well as the
                     great saints (in particular, St Thomas Aquinas). He wrote them as freely and
                     openly as he wrote anyone and, during the 1970s, they were his most intimate
                     friends</p>

            <scopecontent><p> By examining these typescripts in relation to the published pieces--both the
                  Dialogue and the Journal article--we get a close look at Griffin's method. The
                  Correspondence from this period--between Griffin and Fr. Thompson; between Griffin
                  and Ramparts editor/publisher Ed Keating; between Griffin and Bishop Greco (Fr
                  Thompson's superior); as well as the correspondences of the priest and the bishop
                  (and both of these men with Keating of Ramparts)--document an interesting struggle
                  that all experienced. Bishop Greco tried to block the interview on the grounds
                  that Fr. Thompson's documented experience of racism by the Church would not be
                  good for the Church. Eventually, the interview ran, setting off a controversy that
                  reached beyond Bishop Greco's diocese to the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in
                  the US during the 1960s.</p>

            <scopecontent><p><title render="italic">The Reader</title>, published by Houghton Mifflin in 1968,
                  was a 600 page cloth edition of Griffin's best work to that time; the collection
                  sold 40,000 copies, but was never reissued in a paperback edition. <title render="italic">The Reader</title> included condensed versions of his two
                  published novels--<title render="italic">The Devil Rides Outside</title> and
                     <title render="italic">Nuni</title>; ample selections from two other published
                     books--<title render="italic">Land of the Hiqh Sky</title>, a history of the
                  staked plains region of west Texas, and <title render="italic">Black Like
                  Me</title>. Three other sections completed the volume: a section of his
                  photographic portraits, a gathering of journalistic pieces on racism, and a
                  selection of "works-in-progress" that included two chapters from <title render="italic">Scattered Shadows</title>. The <title render="italic">Reader</title> was edited by Bradford Daniel, who also condensed the two novels
                  and introduced each portion of the collection. The volume also contained an essay
                  on Griffin's work by literary historian Maxwell Geismar, and several excerpts from
                  Griffin's journals.. This series contains Griffin's correspondence with both
                  Daniel and editors at Houghton Mifflin, and photocopies of the front matter to the
                  book. There are no working manuscripts as everything was gathered from mostly
                  published sources, and all selecting and editing were carried out by Daniel , who
                  was Griffin's secretary at that time. (Copies of published reviews are included..
                  While <title render="italic">The Reader</title> was being readied for publication,
                  Griffin was still lecturing on racism full-time, in order both to fulfill what he
                  considered his obligation (under spiritual direction) to the civil rights
                  struggle, and to support his wife and four children.. Besides the lecture circuit
                  and writing magazine pieces on racism, Griffin worked on the manuscript of <title render="italic">Scattered Shadows</title> whenever possible.. <title render="italic">Scattered Shadows</title>, the autobiography of his loss of
                  sight, decade of blindness, and eventual sight-recovery, has never been published
                  as a book. The first 11 of 20 chapters were completed for Houghton Mifflin in 1967
                  and a contract was issued. However, Griffin never revised the last 9 chapters
                  (which would have come from his ongoing journals) because the events of 1968
                  forced him back on the lecture circuit and also to the trouble spots of racial
                  strife.. He never returned to the autobiography even after the explosions of 1968
                  had passed because; near the end of that year his friend and colleague, Thomas
                  Merton, died of accidental electrocution in Bangkok (on December 10).. After
                  negotiations with other publishers, Griffin and Houghton Mifflin agreed on a
                  contract for the production of a photographic book (including Merton's photographs
                  and drawings and Griffin's portraits of the monk and photographs of the Abbey of
                  Gethsemani and its spacious grounds, along with texts by Griffin). The project
                  eventually became <title render="italic">A Hidden Wholeness: The Visual World of
                     Thomas Merton</title>, published by Houghton 1970. Early on in the process of
                  making this visual book, Griffin interacted with the three members of the Merton
                  Legacy Trust. By spring of 1969, the Trust decided to offer the "Official
                  Biography" to Griffin. At first, he declined; later, he accepted the invitation,
                  hoping that this new large work would support his family and allow him to withdraw
                  from the lecture circuit and write full-time. Considering how difficult lecturing
                  had became due to various medical set-backs and resolving any guilt he might have
                  felt for not continuing the civil rights struggle, he leaped into the project with
                  enthusiasm.. Griffin hoped that <title render="italic">Scattered Shadows</title>
                  would be published after the Merton biography--both by Houghton-Mifflin. However,
                  researching the biography took several more years than he had anticipated--partly
                  because the subject was so complex and far-reaching and partly due to his own
                  declining health--and there was never time to return to the autobiography.. The
                  two chapters that appear in <title render="italic">The Reader</title> were first
                  published in <title render="italic">Ramparts</title> magazine. In fact, the
                  chapters appeared twice in that Catholic periodical--first, in 1963, when <title render="italic">Ramparts</title> was a quarterly with limited circulation, and
                  then again, in 1966, when it had become a widely-read monthly. A third chapter,
                  entitled "My Friend, Reverdy" in <title render="italic">The Reader</title>, first
                  appeared in <title render="italic">Southwest Review</title>, the SMU literary
                  quarterly. Various other pieces from the manuscript were published in such
                  Catholic magazines as <title render="italic">Jubilee</title> and <title render="italic">Catholic World</title>; and an account of his recovery of sight
                  was published in <title render="italic">Readers Digest</title> and in the
                  anthology <title render="italic">The Spirit of Man</title>.. This series contains
                  a photocopy of the <title render="italic">Ramparts</title> chapters published in
                  that magazine, as well as 20 file folders containing typescript carbons of the
                  first 11 chapters from the unfinished manuscript. (Also six of Griffin's original
                  file folders with typed labels made by the author.). These various chapter drafts
                  afford glimpses of Griffin's manner of line by line revision and section by
                  section reorganization--especially when compared to the few chapters that were
                  published.</p>

                           Hour</title>. These are among the most profound letters Griffin. He had
                        always been a fan of her novels--<title render="italic">Strange
                        Fruit</title> had a deep effect on him which he discusses in <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title>--and long wanted to meet her. They
                        visited twice at her Georgia home. During those visits and in their very
                        personal correspondence, they discovered an uncanny resonance and deep
                        affection. Like Griffin, she was a musician, a Southern novelist, and had
                        high regard for everything French. Griffin says in one of his letters to her
                        that he felt as if Lillian Smith and John Howard Griffin were twins, even
                        though she was nearly twenty years his senior. They came from the same
                        background, discovered their own inculcated racism in similar ways, and
                        fought courageously against prejudice, especially in the south. Both were
                        ostracized for their public stand and for their controversial books, both
                        fiction and non-fiction. Also, both were ill a great deal of their lives,
                        and speak very personally about these afflictions. Some of the strongest
                        passages by Smith are about her own work and about the work of Griffin. Her
                        insights into her own method and her brilliant readings of Griffin's books
                        are highly edifying to any serious reader or scholar.</p>

                        not a brilliant critic, a passionately intelligent reader. Smith's books
                        were among Griffin's favorite, and she was one of the very few contemporary
                        writers he bothered to read (he rarely read contemporary fiction because he
                        feared he would become unconsciously imitative of other styles). Aside from
                        the many rich aspects of this correspondence, I discovered in Griffin's

                        lyrical works we have. She worked without a light meter and with very simple
                        cameras, learning photography by trial and error. In 1968, Griffin gave her
                        a light meter, quite astonished that she had achieved such mastery of light
                        without the instrument. Griffin considered Nell Dorr the supreme American
                        photographer. He took many lovely portraits of her which have not been
                        published.</p>

                  Griffin in his "Prologue" to <title render="italic">Follow the Ecstasy</title>; as
                  well, there is a discussion of their affinities in Robert Bonazzi's "Foreword" to
                  the Orbis Books edition of <title render="italic">Follow the Ecstasy</title>. The
                  correspondence focuses on a wide range of subjects--race relations, the Vietnam
                  War, major change in the Church under Pope John XXIII, and their mutual friendship
                  with French philosopher Jacques Maritain, etc. The most discussed subject,
                  however, turned out to be Merton's new-found passion for photography, which was
                  greatly encouraged by Griffin (who gave the monk a good camera and processed his
                  negatives).</p>

                     of The Merton Legacy Trust. The book consists of a short text by Griffin, his
                     photographs of Merton and the surrounding environment, and Merton's own
                     photographs and paintings (which he called "calligraphs" or
                     "signatures"--abstract miniatures suggesting the influences of Franz Kline,

                     also wrote the Preface. A Revised edition was published by Orbis Books in 1993.
                     This paperback includes a 16 page glossy folio of Griffin photographs and a new
                     Foreword by the editor. The Orbis edition is entitled: <title render="italic">Follow the Ecstasy: The Hemitage Years of Thomas Merton</title>.. [It is
                     important to note here that <title render="italic">Follow the Ecstasy</title>
                     represents only a portion of Griffin's proposed "Official Biography of Thomas

                     from the unfinished biography, is documented in Robert Bonazzi's "Foreword" to

            <scopecontent><p> Jacques Maritain, author of thirty books of philosophy and theology, was one of
                  the most important Catholic writers of the 20th Century. He and his wife, the poet
                  Raissa Maritain, are remembered in more than a dozen biographies, as well as in
                  her popular memoirs--in particular, <title render="italic">We Were Friends
                     Together</title>, which tells the story of the famous French circle that
                  gathered around the Maritains in the 1930s and 1940s in Paris. They were in close
                  consort with the many great artists of that period, including Picasso, Braque,
                  Reverdy, the philosophers Gilson and Pegeuy, the composer Lourie, American painter
                  Abraham Rattner, and many others. The Maritains were converted to Catholicism by
                  the radical philosopher Leon Bloy during their student days. Maritain, known
                  principally for his work on St. Thomas Aquinas, was considered the ultimate
                  Thomist in modern times. He had great influence over Thomas Merton and John Howard
                  Griffin--also Catholic converts--who considered the French philosopher to be their
                  friend and mentor. Griffin, in particular, saw Maritain as his ultimate mentor and
                  spiritual guide.</p>

               </did>
               <scopecontent><p> For an in-depth discussion of the controversial ideas in Jacques Maritain's
                     last book, a reading of the Griffin interview with Maritain is illuminating.
                     However, there is a story behind the book's publication in America, and this
                     story behind the story is revealed in the correspondences that follow. This
                     short morality play features a French publisher, several American publishers, a
                     French literary agent based in Manhattan, a translator, concerned friends like
                     Thomas Merton and John Howard Griffin, and the elderly layman who called
                     himself "the peasant of Garonne" (Jacques Maritain). Georges Borchardt, a
                     literary agent for the Paris publishing house, Declee de Brouwer (which
                     published the original edition of <title render="italic">Peasant</title>)
                     offered both the Maritain book and French edition of Raissa Maritain's <title render="italic">Journal</title> to Charles Scribner's Sons of New York. The
                     legendary Scribner, a long-time friend of the Maritains and the publisher of
                     many of the philosopher's books in English, was interested in <title render="italic">Peasant</title> but not the poetic reflections of Raissa's
                     Journal. Displeased with Scribner and Borchardt, Maritain wrote the publisher
                     to say that either both books would be published by his old publisher or
                     neither would be published under his imprint. And he turned the proceedings
                     over to his friend, John Howard Griffin, who agreed to find an appropriate
                     American publisher for both books, as well as translators.. However, as Griffin
                     made contacts with publishers--and had interest from Arabel Porter at New
                     American Library and Ralph Manheim at Harcourt--Borchardt was contacting other
                     New York publishers with the encouragement of the original French publisher,
                     Deciee de Brouwer. Borchardt managed to interest Joseph Cunneen, the religious
                     editor at Holt, Rinehart and Winston, in <title render="italic">Peasant</title>, reaching preliminary agreement on a contract. When Maritain
                     hear of this from Cunneen, he wrote to say that he was not against Holt
                     publishing his book, but insisted that Griffin and not Borchardt handle the
                     negotiations (as well as choose the translator). At the same time, Borchardt
                     wrote Griffin to say that he had came to terms with Holt on behalf of Declee de
                     Brouwer. Griffin, in an agony of embarrassment because this was exactly the
                     sort of tension he wanted to avoid for Maritain, was forced to alert NAL and
                     Harcourt of the mess, as well as correspond with Holt to make certain that the
                     contract did not violate Maritain's wishes.. Finally, after several rounds of
                     letters, the issue was clarified.. Holt would publish <title render="italic">Peasant</title>, Borchardt would be the link between Holt and Declee de
                     Brouwer, and Griffin would select the translator. In the shuffle, there was no
                     mention of Raissals Journal, so Griffin went elsewhere with that project,
                     eventually landing it with Magi Books several years later. Michael Cuddihy was
                     chosen to translate with the understanding that his English version would be
                     examined by Griffin, Thomas Merton, and Joseph Evans of the Maritain society --
                     all trusted Maritain friends and translators (from French) in their own right..
                     All the preceding took place from November 1966 until the spring of 1967. At
                     that point, a complete retyping of the Cuddihy translation had to be made at
                     Holt, and Maritain became concerned about the slow progress. For some of the
                     others there was a greater problem: No one was very impressed with the
                     translation. So, after making changes suggested by Merton and Evans, Griffin
                     took the translation to France, spending several weeks working it over with
                     Maritain, who was not impressed with Cuddihy's work either. The accepted
                     translation was dispatch by Maritain to Griffin's hands and then on to Joseph
                     Cunneen at Holt, who made the point that not only had Cuddihy improved his work
                     as he went along (and that his work had been further improved by Merton and
                     Griffin especially), but that he was not pleased with Maritain's low opinion of
                     the translation or with the philosopher's changes which he felt were neither
                     "that extensive nor that helpful". When all the smoke of ego had cleared, the
                     book was published by Holt with a portrait of Maritain (by Griffin) on its dust
                     jacket. It sold well and went into a paperback-reprint by MacMillan (again with
                     Griffin's portrait as the cover). Extensive detail is revealed by the actual
                     documents</p>

               <scopecontent><p> A 64-page large format book of photographs and texts, published by Magi Books
                     in 1974. This is the same Albany, NY publisher who brought out Raissa's <title render="italic">Journal</title> and also Maritain's <title render="italic">Notebooks</title>. All three of these books are still in print. The <title render="italic">Homaqe</title> consists of an essay on Maritain by
                     philosopher Yves Simon; this one of many written by a close friend and
                     colleague, who illuminates Maritain's ideas and personality for the general
                     reader. The second part of this "homage in words" is by John Howard Griffin,
                     excerpts from journals kept while visiting with Martain in Princeton (1962),
                     Fort Worth and Gethsemani (1966), Kolbsheim (1967) and Toulouse (1970).. The
                     book ends with Griffin's 1973 entry about the last days of the philosopher. The
                     book opens with a Foreword by Anthony Simon, son of Yves Simon, that reflects
                     on the friendship of his father and Maritain. The magnificent photos throughout
                     the book are by Griffin</p>

            <scopecontent><p> Commissioned by MacMillan as a book on racism for young adults, <title render="italic">A Time To Be Human</title> was published in 1977. It was
                  Griffin's last book about racism (and human rights issues), as well as a summation
                  of all his work in this area:. With <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title>
                  and <title render="italic">The Church and the Black Man</title> it forms a
                  remarkable trilogy. The text reprises the <title render="italic">Black Like
                  Me</title> experience with different anecdotes and a re-evaluation of the 1960s;
                  and it draws on many of his <title render="italic">Sepia</title> articles from the
                  1970s, as well as updated materials. Begun as a tape recording, Griffin worked up
                  the published book through three manuscript drafts, giving the scholar a rare
                  overview of his method.. The series includes Griffin's Original Typescript of the
                  First Draft, a 73 page manuscript, with the author's corrections. Major changes
                  can be studied in Griffin's Second Draft, also the Original Typescript, which runs
                  to 71 manuscript pages. Finally, there is the 75 page manuscript of the Final
                  Draft (a photocopy), including both the author's and the editor's changes. The
                  Editor in this instance was David Reuther of MacMillan, who had made Griffin's
                  acquaintance through correspondence regarding another MacMillan publication for
                  young adults--the Cornelia and Irving Sussman biography of Thomas Merton. Griffin
                  provided the cover photographs for the Merton biography, as well as advice to its
                  authors, the husband and wife team who were his close friends (see their
                  correspondence in Series VII)</p>

            <scopecontent><p> During his last decade, Griffin concentrated most of his energies on the research
                  and writing of the official Biography of Thomas Merton--a project he relinquished
                  to a second biographer (Michael Mott) in 1977. In order to support his family, he
                  also became an editor for <title render="italic">Sepia</title>, the monthly
                  magazine which had serialized his "Journey into Shame" articles which eventually
                  became <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title>. Also, he lectured at
                  universities on the theme of racism, but he spoke about Thomas Merton's
                  spirituality as well. He traveled increasingly to Toronto, where he developed a
                  huge Catholic student following, lecturing in Canada more often than in the
                  States. By 1976, he experienced a serious decline in health, with complications
                  that eventually ended his hope of completing the Merton biography. But from
                  1969-1972, he was. in reasonably good health, and completed most of the Merton
                  research in a series of retreats at the monk's hermitage on the grounds of the
                  Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky. Series XIII and XIV cover that period and
                  document the Merton connection. Series XVIII is the journal he kept at Gethsemani,
                  a book he worked on in 1979 and 1980, the year he died.. Even though he worked
                  most diligently on the Merton materials until 1977, he did manage to write and
                  publish a wide variety of shorter pieces and complete an immense number of
                  photographic works.</p>

               <scopecontent><p> Joe Noonan, staff cartoonist for <title render="italic">WAY</title> Magazine,
                     first wrote to Griffin in 1971. Soon the two men were corresponding so
                     regularly--and ultimately much more voluminously than Griffin corresponded with
                     anyone in. his lifetime--that the file of Noonan letters to Griffin numbers
                     1,592 pieces. This is staggering when one considers that this computes to one
                     letter every other day arriving in Griffin's mailbox for nine years (from 1971
                     until 1980). The pieces vary from postcards and notes to hundreds of
                     single-spaced typed letters (totaling ever 3,000 pages). Noonan was an
                     extremely clever cartoonist and nearly 800 of the 948 envelopes are decorated
                     with his witty cartoons (and nearly all of these take-offs on the ongoing
                     correspondence). Cartoons decorate the letters also; there are an estimated
                     4,000 original cartoons in the file.. While the accent of the correspondence is
                     one of humor (subtle, bawd , satiric, absurd, and downright silly at times),
                     there are also many Noonan letters that evoke seriousness--discussions of
                     literature, politics, religion and society. Noonan's letters, however, are most
                     notable for their wide range of humor--not only cartoons, but hundreds of loony
                     news items and photographs that were often altered with the cartoonist's sharp
                     pen. Noonan's primary motive was to keep a beleaguered and often very ill
                     author cheered up, laughing, and several steps away from taking it all too
                     seriously. Griffin loved his letters (and envelopes) and perhaps nothing else
                     cheered him so jubilantly in his last years, (1977-1980) especially.. The
                     little we know of Griffin's side of the correspondence (a safe estimate would
                     be about 1,200 letters which are in Noonan's possession) is what is reflected
                     in the Noonan letters. Also, we have an excellent article about the
                     correspondence written by the cartoonist after Griffin's death, and published
                     in a special issue of <title render="italic">Way</title> magazine exclusively
                     dedicated to various aspects of the author.</p>

                     Thomas Merton</title>, this 231 page published book charts Griffin's 18 visits
                  to Merton's hermitage, from August 5, 1969 through June 15, 1972 (plus three other
                  entries made at his home in Fort Worth, Texas). The edition includes a short
                  preface by Griffin--his last piece of writing composed for publication--and a
                  folio of his photographs of the hermitage and its surroundings. The cloth edition
                  was published by Andrews and McMeel in 1981, the year after Griffin's death; a
                  paperback version appeared a few years later under Doubleday's Image imprint..
                  Like <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title>, this book is a diary set apart
                  from Griffin's ongoing Journal (1950-1980), and was intended as a self-contained
                  work for publication. The scholar will not find either text in the overall
                  pagination of the Journal, even though there are other entries for the years (in
                  which these two books were composed) in that larger 3,000 page compendium.
                  Nonetheless, if one were to read the two published diaries and the Journal
                  chronologically, the overall story of Griffin's life-line continues uninterrupted
                  from 1950 to 1980.. In the case of <title render="italic">The Hermitage
                  Journals</title>, the text was first drafted as a diary from 1969-1972. That draft
                  was edited and a second draft was made in 1978-1979 by Griffin in collaboration
                  with Father Tom McKillop, the author's close friend and spiritual guide during the
                  last three years of life. That second draft was edited by Conger Beasley for the
                  cloth edition. But because both Father McKillop and Griffin's widow, Elizabeth,
                  did not favor all the deletions Beasley had made from the second draft, yet a
                  fourth and final draft was agreed upon for cloth publication.. <title render="italic">The Hermitage Journals</title>, then, was the last book Griffin
                  prepared for publication under contract, although it appeared posthumously.</p>

               <scopecontent><p> [When one considers <title render="italic">The Hermitage Journals</title> in
                     connection with <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title> and <title render="italic">Scatttered Shadows</title>, there emerges a fascinating
                     subject for scholarship. These books form an autobiographical trilogy that is
                     unique in subject matter and intensely original in the evocation of these
                     experiences. How many whites have experienced being black? How many social
                     creatures have embraced hermetic solitude? How many have lost their eyesight,
                     endured a decade of blindness and then had vision restored? Surely, these
                     singular realities are among the most misunderstood and nowhere in our
                     literature are they made so understandable from the inside out. Griffin found
                     such human conditions, however contradictory on the surface, profoundly unified
                     in the realm of the spirit. He discovered that being blind or black or being a
                     hermit simply meant being human--that the experience itself was far less
                     difficult and painful than the dehumanizing perceptions of those in the
                     majority, who did not see the individual but only that condition of appearing

            <scopecontent><p> "In my teens, when I was a student at the Lyc&amp;eacute;ee Descartes, in
                  Tours, France," wrote Griffin in the unpublished preface to his Journal, "a man I
                  greatly admired suggested that I begin keeping a journal of my life. He said it
                  was one way of learning to know myself provided I let no one else see it, wrote it
                  honestly and wrote in it even when I felt I had nothing to say.". From the age of
                  sixteen until he was twenty-one, Griffin continued his journal; but when France
                  was about to fall to the Germans, he gave the autograph journals to a schoolmate
                  for safe-keeping, and returned to the states. "Years later when I returned to
                  France [in 19761, I retrieved the journal which had been buried on my friend's
                  father's farm during the war." He began to read his reflections. "It was a
                  sickening experience. Pages were filled with literary analyses, musical analyses,
                  foods we ate, with scarcely a word about the supreme reality of the war which
                  preoccupied us day and night. It was pure escape from that reality rather than any
                  attempt to handle it. I was heartsick to find myself so false.... I burned those
                  pages and did not resume [a journal] until some years later when I was blind and
                  had learned to use the typewriter.". Curiously, it was again on the advice of a
                  man he admired--the theatre critic John Mason Brown--that Griffin began to write.
                  But it was not a journal; it was his first novel, <title render="italic">The Devil
                     Rides Outside</title>, written in 1949. His mature Journal was launched in
                  December of 1950, during the third year of sightlessness. When.he was not working
                  on novels or short stories, he poured impressions into the Journal, which became a
                  seedbed for most of work he would publish later. We find in its pages fragments
                  and drafts of stories and novels; essays and articles; voluminous meditations on
                  ethics, religion and philosophy; responses to the music he listened to constantly;
                  discussions of cooking, farming and family relationships; insights into the
                  realities of blindness and how the condition is wrongly perceived by the sighted;
                  speculations on psychology, sociology, anthropology and the arts in relation to
                  the diminishment of culture in America. We hear every tone of voice from the
                  compassionate to the dismissive; styles that range from lyric to polemic, from the
                  scholarly to the absurd. At times he was naive and narrowly opinionated; at other
                  times, measured and wise. He reflected on literature and life--the books he had
                  read (and those which were read to him or recorded on tapes) and all the places he
                  had traveled and lived. He was always a bit nostalgic for the high culture of
                  France and the great joy of learning he had discovered in that adopted land;
                  nostalgic also for the year he spent on a remote island in the South Seas living
                  among the native inhabitants. Conversely, he had been horrified by war--both what
                  he had witnessed working in the French Underground and the devastation of combat
                  while in the Air Force in the Pacific.. Reading the Journal one is always aware
                  that it is an intensely human document--full of contradictions and paradoxes; hope
                  and despair; criticism of the world and self-criticism; fear and anguish over what
                  often did not matter, as well as heroism in the face of what mattered most. The
                  writing is, by turns, elegant and crude; often brilliant and sometimes ignorant;
                  and splattered with passages that roar with comic hyperbole or soar with a
                  spiritual clarity. But always one reads as if one has discovered a secret
                  document; that one is looking over the shoulder of a man who is truely alive in
                  the immense process of becoming a genuine artist and thinker. And later we meet
                  the justly famous author who has absorbed the profound wisdom of humility.. This
                  massive Journal runs to 2,762 pages of single-spaced typed pages. This page count
                  does not include ten autograph notebooks he kept away from the typewriter nor the
                  published books (previously mentioned) that were pulled out of the overall Journal
                  and composed into separate books.. During the period of his blindness--recorded in
                  the Journal from December of 1950 until sight-recovery in January of 1957--he
                  typed almost 900 pages in a span of just slightly more than six years. That is
                  roughly 150 pages each year. Yet, the count for 1951, the first full year of
                  keeping the Journal, is 231 pages (the third highest volume for any year). This
                  was a period of intense introspection for Griffin, he was in the process of making
                  what the French call "the great yes" or the leap of faith from indecision to
                  belief; Griffin became a convert to Catholicism in 1952.. In 1954 we find the
                  second most voluminous year with 255 pages. That year, he was suffering not only
                  from the complications of blindness and diabetes, but he had contracted spinal
                  malaria--a condition which paralyzed him from the waist down and confined him to a
                  wheelchair. All he could do was sit at the typewriter, listen to music, and
                  write.. The entries of 1954 record a very real agony and ecstasy. Griffin
                  experienced the most alienating depths of despair alternating with some of the
                  greatest spiritual heights of his life. Without the love and understanding of his
                  young wife (Elizabeth Holland and Griffin married in 1953), as well as his parents
                  and also her parents--and with absolute faith in God--he would not have survived
                  the ordeal. Instead he wrote about everything that year and drafted over 400 pages
                  of <title render="italic">Nuni</title>, his second novel.. In the decade of
                  blindness--from 1947 to early 1957--Griffin composed five novels (two were
                  published, two remain unpublished and the fifth was lost); over sixty short
                  stories (most unpublished); a short book on blindness (<title render="italic">Handbook For Darkness</title>); music lectures and articles; and nearly a
                  thousand pages in the Journal . Virtually all of his fiction--literally thousands
                  of pages--were written during the decade of sightlessness. Except for revisions of
                  earlier novels in draft and one short piece of humor ("Pilgrimage"), his career as
                  a fiction writer was over when he regained his sight.. During the 1960s he managed
                  to average over100 pages per year in the Journal, including the second highest
                  page count (248) in 1966. In general, however, these entries move away from
                  introspection toward the concerns of a public life--a-decade which found him away
                  from the studio and his expanding family and in a world of turmoil. His writings
                  were much shorter and their focus was temporal not eternal. He published polemical
                  and journalistic articles on racism, injustice, war, censorship, politics, and
                  lectured extensively on these same issues (and, of course, specifically- on his
                  experiences in <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title>, its aftermath, and
                  the civil rights battles that followed. He wrote brilliantly and courageously, and
                  his lectures and writings were in great demand. But the public life took its toll
                  on the books he was forced to leave unfinished (novels as well as <title render="italic">Scattered Shadows</title>), and what limited private time that
                  remained was spent with his family and friends and in the darkroom (where his
                  photographic career blossomed), but not in the writing studio. Those years also
                  took their toll on his fragile health. He was no longer blind and the paralysis
                  had lasted only one year, but the stress of his schedule far from solitude
                  increased the debilitating effects of his diabetic condition. He experienced
                  blackouts and exhaustion. His Journal records all this activity in a cryptic
                  rather than expansive manner.. With his appointment as the Official Biographer of
                  Thomas Merton, illness turned toward relative health, exhaustion was replaced by
                  energy, and Griffin once again found spiritual joy in solitude and a fascinating
                  long-range project. The Journal, from 1970-1980 runs about 650 pages--about 65
                  pages as an annual average with only 1975 accumulating more than 200 pages. This
                  drop in production was a result of the work on the biography and that includes
                     <title render="italic">The Hermitage Journals</title> factored out of the
                  equation, as well as a tremendous amounts of photographic work--choices that
                  Griffin was pleased to make, of course. But other factors--not of his
                  choosing--also impacted upon the Journal. There was a significant decline in his
                  health (this is why the entries are more than three times the volume of 1970-1974;
                  he was confined and unable to travel to Gethsemani and Europe where so much
                  research had been accomplished); and there was also the countless intrusions of
                  the curious making pilgrimages to his door.. The Autograph Notebooks, which
                  Griffin considered part of his overall Journal, are from widely different
                  time-frames. Written in spiral notebooks or bound composition books that Griffin
                  carried on his travels when having a typewriter was impossible or inconvenient;
                  these generally reflect a specific event or span of days that can be integrated by
                  dated passage into the overall scheme of his personal Journal.</p>

                     concerts I ever heard. Like Lipatti and Schnabel combined". The next morning he
                     visited the Rijks Museum, "seeing the Rembrandts, Vermeers, etc. Tremendous. To
                     the Van Gogh Museum this afternoon." After three days in Amsterdam, he spent
                     three days in Brussels, staying with the psychiatrist and Merton enthusiast Dr.
                     Vander-Elst. On February 2nd, he took the train to Strasbourg and was met by
                     his old friends, Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius. These great friends of the
                     Maritains drove Griffin and his daughter to their Chateau at Kolbsheim (the
                     repository of the papers of Jacques and Raissa Maritain), where they stayed a
                     few days.. Griffin then spent five days with Jacques Maritain in Toulouse,
                     where the 87 year old philosopher had a tiny hermitage on the grounds where the
                     motherhouse of the Little Brothers and Sisters Order is located. Many passaqes
                     here about Maritain, several of the sisters who did his secretarial work
                     (Sister Marie Pascale, in particular, who typed the philosopher's manuscripts
                     and letters--her signature is under many of Maritain's letters on file at HRC),
                     as well as several interesting cooking experiences with Sister Marie Emmanuel..
                     A week later, Griffin made several trips to Prades (Merton's birthplace),
                     Montaubin and St. Antonin (where Merton lived as a child), and on to Paris,
                     photographing and notetaking all the way. On February 14, he visited with the
                     daughter of Leon Bloy, the French writer and thinker who was instrumental in
                     converting the Maritains to Catholicism, after a search of several days. Part
                     of this experience, though not mentioned in this notebook, laid the groundwork
                     for his last piece of fiction--the humorous take-off upon hearing the sweet
                     sound of a sackbutt (<title render="italic">Pilgrimage</title>, Latitudes

                     period at Loretto Heights University in Denver, Colorado. Griffin went to
                     Loretto Heights for two weeks every year during the 1970s to lecture, teach
                     classes and conduct seminars on various aspects of society: racism, injustice,
                     freedom, spirituality--and how the person is thus affected by these realities.
                     In this comfortable academic setting, he was able to develop a deeper set of
                     ideas than one three hour lecture at a university or church could
                     provide--especially when he was in another city by the next day. He enjoyed
                     these times at Loretto Heights, a Catholic institution known for its
                     progressive system which was influenced by Sister Mary Luke Tobin, a close
                     associate of both Merton and Griffin over the years. He utilized this annual
                     visit to Denver to develop his ongoing lectures more deeply, benefitting from
                     the learned response of some of the faculty, as well as a pool of intelligent
                     Catholic students, including many from foreign countries. His daughter Susan
                     was a student at Loretto Heights and her tuition was given in exchange for
                     Griffin's annual appearances.. The lecture notes themselves will give the
                     scholar a clear idea of the way in which Griffin built up the background for
                     his lectures--scholarly research to give context to speeches that were always
                     based on personal experience and more often than not about his <title render="italic">Black Like Me</title> and subsequent civil rights work..
                     Here the background is separated out from the foreground; the objective set
                     apart from the subjective while his speeches integrate both realms.</p>

                     woods. He was at the time teaching writing at The Upper Midwest Writing
                     Conference [see Series XVII for related information and correspondence].
                     Griffin simply records the solitary time and does not mention the conference at
                     all. He records the birdcalls, describes the lake and woods, remarks about
                     being awake at dawn--and then compares his sense of unity there as reminiscent
                     of his time at Merton's hermitage four years earlier, July 1976.. The second
                     section finds Griffin recuperating from several heart attacks after a month
                     long tour from October 20 to November 20 (mostly in Canada). That tour ended in
                     Rochester, New York where he was barely able to make his appearance. Returning
                     to Fort Worth, he kept his Journal in this notebook on a bed desk his wife had
                     purchased, because he was unable to work on his studio typewriter. Very ill, he
                     convinced the doctor to let him remain at home instead of going to the
                     hospital. Slowly, he begins to improve in the warm context of his family--wife
                     and younger daughter (Amanda), as well as his mother (Lena Griffin), all
                     helping and staying watch. Each day he received communion from his close
                     friend, Father George Curtsinger (photographer, pianist, writer; books
                     published by Latitudes). November 27 to December 3, 1976.</p>

                     outline form and is clearly influenced by Maritain's aesthetic works. He begins
                     with his view of writing that "creative writing cannot be taught, but we can
                     learn to remove many of the impediments to creativity". Discussion of various
                     elements: characterization, writer as creative filter, challenge to express the
                     inexpressible, universality of experience ("you have to become all men at all
                     times: leave yourself and become the other. Gamble on truth"). How keeping a
                     journal can aid in these ventures: "This means that sometimes, for the sake of
                     truth, you have to write things that are personally offensive to you .... This
                     comes most most naturally from keeping an absolutely private journal." Then
                     there is a section entitled "Essences and Accidentals" which is a five page
                     outline of Maritain's ideas from <title render="italic">Creative Intuition in
                        Art and Poetry</title> (Griffin's aesthetic Bible). Finally, some Griffin
                     notes on techniques, revision, things to avoid and misplaced motivations.
                     [included herein is a folder containing one stray sheet of notes in Griffin's
                     hand, plus a three-page carbon typescript he made from Maritain's <title render="italic">Creative Intuition</title>, ("definitions of art").]. The
                     remainder of this notebook is as profound in the personal sense as the first
                     portion is in the artistic sense. Griffin arrived in Toronto on June 11, 1977.
                     He was met at the airport by Dr. Viktor Frankel, a thinker Griffin had long
                     admired and was meeting for the first time. Frankel is best known for his first
                     book, <title render="italic">Man's Search for Meaning</title>. His account of
                     enduring a Nazi concentration camp and the existential opus that begins his
                     psychoanalytical career as the founder of logotherapy. The next day, Griffin
                     had a long dialogue with Frankel which he called, ..a great interview. I have
                     never in my life met a man whose thoughts and conclusions so nearly matched my
                     own." Griffin discusses Frankel's ideas at great length and their affinity to
                     his own, less systematic worldview.. Also at great length, Griffin discusses
                     his depleted physical energy due to diabetes and heart-related ailments. "My
                     problem, my physical condition obliges me to make demands on others that go
                     against my conscience. When others through love and perception sense the needs
                     and volunteer the aid, then the conflict ceases and is replaced by an
                     overwhelming gratitude. It has always been profoundly repellant to me to have
                     to ask someone for what must be given. That is the great dissonance of my life:
                     My needs, for example, deprive my wife, Tom [Father Tom McKillop], even my
                     children, of the peace and rest they need...no matter how willing they are to
                     help. Because I try to hold off asking until too late, I face them with crises
                     and fatigue. This destroys me and worsens the condition. I hold off asking
                     (imposing) until I then grow sick and cry out for help.". In rereading the
                     "Scattered Shadows" chapters in <title render="italic">The Reader</title>,
                     Griffin was deeply struck by the attitude (of false heroism) he had while
                     slowly losing his sight in France thirty years earlier, in 1946. But he
                     recognized the falsity then and overcame his own hypocrisy. "Strange indeed--my
                     present helplessness and confusion wiped from memory the very meaning of that
                     earlier discovery. There I could find finally objective meaning--the fragments
                     were finally perceived as a whole. This time [with one leg amputated, with
                     regular heart failures, constant pain and insomnia] I have been unable to do
                     that--so meaning is too often replaced by sadness, even despair, even blackness
                     without light but I cannot feel it too often Too often everything, even
                     knowledge and perception seem wiped out by the heart-organ's physical inability
                     to function--so the symbolic and real heart get clouded, desperate, fragmented,
                     unwhole--and I know and hate-it-and beg for help.... Dr. Frankel refreshed
                     these dim memories that have so permeated all my work."</p>

                  lived another fifty days, expiring of a cerebral hemorrhage on September 9, 1980.
                  He was less than three months into his sixtieth year. The funeral was held on
                  September 11, and Griffin was buried at the Mansfield Cemetery, Mansfield, Texas,
                  next to the grave of his old friend, Clyde Parker Holland (father of Griffin's
                  widow, Elizabeth). He was survived by his wife, four children, his mother,
                  brother, and two sisters.. Griffin's funeral was attended by hundreds of friends,
                  family members, and devoted acquaintances. The Mass was written by Father Tom
                  McKillop--a moving ceremony that included many of Griffin's words read and

                  <unittitle>Zara Nelsova Zara Nelsova was born in Winnipeg in 1918. Her parents had
                     emigrated from Russia in 1910. Zara made her solo orchestral debut, playing the
                     Lalo Concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra under Malcolm Sargent. After
                     the war Nelsova was able to realize her lifelong ambition of studying with
                     Pablo Casals. In 1955, Nelsova gave a landmark series of recitals for solo
                     cello in London and New York and in 1966, she became the first North American
                     cellist to tour the Soviet Union. Zara was the favorite cellist of Ernest
                     Bloch, who wrote three Solo Suites for her and presided as conductor for her
                     recording of his Schelomo. Samuel Barber also chose her as soloist for a
                     recording of his Cello Concerto, with him conducting. She died in 1995.,
