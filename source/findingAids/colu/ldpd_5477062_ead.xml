            <abstract>The collection consists of monthly correspondence from Jenny S. Bradley to poet and playwright Susan Sherman from 1964 to Bradley’s death in 1983.  Bradley, a literary agent and scout, is best known for her work in sponsoring James Joyce’s career, as well as introducing notable French authors such as André Gide, Albert Camus to an American audience.   Her letters include reflections on the later period of her life, personal anecdotes, and commentary on Sherman’s literary work.</abstract>

            <head>History</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->1964 marked the year in which Jenny S. Bradley--Mrs.
                William Aspenwall Bradley--and Susan Sherman began corresponding; a relationship
                which lasted until Bradley's death, at age 97, in 1983. Bradley had made a name for
                herself in publishing as the literary agent who encouraged James Joyce's efforts and
                brought him to the front of the literary scene. In addition to professional
                encouragement, Bradley gave Joyce money, sheets, blankets, and even a table.
                Following World War II, she played a key role in promoting Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert
                Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and others to American audiences abroad. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Bradley was a serious literary presence of the “old guard”;
                an entity that was clearly dying, in her opinion, in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
                As a die-hard “insulaire”, Bradley cultivated relationships with Charles de Gaulle,
                F. Scott Fitzgerald, Rainer Marie Rilke, Charles Seignobos, and others, many of whom
                paraded through weekly literary salons in her apartment on the Ile-St. Louis in
                Paris. Her letters reflect a continued interest with the French literary scene and
                in the literary relationships developed over the years through her work with
                Harcourt, Brace, with Macmillan, and with Gallimard (Bradley's husband had worked as
                the Paris agent for Harcourt, Brace, and Macmillan up until his death in 1939).
                Bradley herself had been approached to complete the French translation of <title render="italic">A
                    Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</title>, and later went on to translate and produce
                Joyce's play <title render="italic">Exiles</title>. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Susan Sherman was introduced to Bradley through the
                literary agent Paul R. Reynolds. Sherman is a poet, playwright and essayist based in
                New York City. She is a founding editor of <title render="italic">IKON</title> magazine and is a member of the
                faculty at Parsons School of Design and Eugene Lang College, where she teaches in
                the culture and media program.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection includes personal letters and postcards dealing primarily with travel
                updates, discussions of books and writers, family issues, and commentary on current
                literary projects. The letters are often three or four pages in length, and are
                mostly written on Bradley's delicate blue onionskin paper. </p>
            <p>In addition to Bradley's letters, the collection includes one file of correspondence
                between Sherman and Genevieve Serruys (Bradley's niece), Francis Steegmuller, and
                “Barry,” all of which was sent to Sherman after 1983. These letters concern legacy
                issues, making reference to a biography and a memorial service following Bradley's
                death.</p>
