         <p>Eleanor Robson Belmont, actress socialite and philanthropist was born December 13, 1878
            in Wigan Lancashire England to an actress mother and a musician father. Her father died
            when she was very young and her mother Madge Carr Cook remarried to the actor Augustus
            Cook immigrated to America. Eleanor was educated in American boarding schools after
            which she joined her mother Madge Carr Cook in the San Francisco-based Frawley Stock
            Company. She quickly graduated to starring roles while touring with the company. In 1900
            she moved to New York where she was signed by the impresario George Tyler of Liebler and
            Company. She was a sensation acclaimed for her beauty her sweet rich speaking voice and
            her natural manner. Her greatest hit was Israel Zangwill's Merely <title render="italic">Mary Ann</title> in 1903. While playing the role in London, she captivated George
            Bernard Shaw who wrote <title render="italic">Major Barbara</title> for her. She was
            never able to play the part she inspired due to contractual obligations, but she
            continued to be a popular draw starring in <title render="italic">Nurse Marjorie</title>
            (1906), <title render="italic">Salomy Jane</title> (1907), and <title render="italic">Dawn of Tomorrow</title> (1909). In 1910, she left the stage to marry the banker,
            August Belmont.</p>
         <p>After marriage, as she tells us in her autobiography <title render="italic">Fabric of
               Memory</title>, life became a "world of horses, polo, social events, new friends,
            civic interests, and farming." She supported her husband's pursuits including the
            Belmont racing stables, the construction of the New York Subway, and the Cape Cod Canal.
            Both Belmonts actively took part in the war effort in World War I. Mrs. Belmont was
            appointed to the American Red Cross and she courageously traveled dangerous waters to
            personally inspect the Red Cross overseas effort. After the war, she helped develop the
            peacetime American Red Cross.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Belmont was widowed in 1924 but continued to be active in philanthropic causes.
            During the Great Depression, she raised funds with the Women's Committee of the Central
            Emergency Unemployment Relief Agency devoting special attention to the needs of the
            single working woman. When World War II broke out Mrs. Belmont again served the war
            effort through the Red Cross. </p>
         <p>Mrs. Belmont maintained her interest in the theater. In 1931, she co-wrote and produced
            a play <title render="italic">In the Next Room</title>. Her theatrical fame and her
            training as an actress had contributed to her success as a fundraiser, and the
            performing arts remained one of her causes. She was especially fond of the Metropolitan
            Opera Company. In 1933, she became the first woman to sit on its Board of Directors. She
            founded the Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1935 as a permanent vehicle for raising money
            and as a basis of support. She lived to see the Opera emerge from the precarious
            financial predicament in which she found it to become a thriving, well-supported,
            well-attended institution.</p>
         <p>Mrs. Belmont died at the age of 101 in 1979. On her hundredth birthday, December 13,
            1978, she had told the <title render="italic">New York Times</title> that, "the secret
            to long life is no diet no special care nothing like that. It's doing what you want and
            doing it happily."</p>
