            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->A prominent defender of the First Amendment, Ephraim S.
                London spent much of his career challenging conservative distinctions between art
                and obscenity. He ranked among the nation's leading constitutional lawyers during
                the 1950s and 1960s, when he litigated a series of major cases pushing for the end
                of censorship in motion pictures. He also helped shepherd <title render="italic">Tropic of Cancer</title> to its
                first American printing - 27 years after Henry Miller had finished writing it.
                London defended Lenny Bruce, the most controversial comedian of the era. He argued
                nine cases before the United States Supreme Court, and was successful each time. The
                simple fact of his taking a case, a reporter for <title render="italic">Variety</title> wrote in 1963, was enough
                “to indicate the importance attached to the subject.” </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Confident in his expertise, London once told a judge in an
                obscenity trial, “Now your honor, I must say that I speak with probably greater
                experience than any other attorney in the United States on the question.” His
                preference was to win cases on constitutional grounds, rather than on procedural
                issues; thus, he could show that free speech, in even its least palatable forms, was
                protected by the First Amendment. At times, his determination to litigate on
                principles got him into trouble with his clients. Nevertheless, he remained firm. In
                the courtroom - as well as through articles and speaking engagements - London
                testified to his beliefs. “I consider censorship an affront,” he said during a
                televised debate, “the assumption of censorship, the assumption of the censor, is
                that the people can't be trusted to make judgments for themselves. I don't believe
                that assumption is proper.” </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->London was born in Brooklyn, on June 17, 1911. Law was the
                family calling. Both his parents, and a sister, were attorneys, as was his uncle -
                Meyer London - one of only two Socialists ever elected to the United States
                Congress. Ephraim graduated with a legal degree from New York University in 1934,
                and began his career in the family firm, earning a salary of $12 a week. Five years
                later, he married Pearl Levison. He served as a captain of anti-aircraft artillery
                during World War Two; after the fighting, he investigated war crimes in Germany. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->His first major First Amendment case involved <title render="italic">The
                Miracle,</title> a Roberto Rosselini film about a woman who mistook her vagabond seducer
                for St. Joseph. The movie was denounced by the Catholic Church in New York, and was
                declared sacrilegious by the state censorship board. Representing Joseph Burstyn,
                the movie's distributor, London took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1952,
                the justices sided with the film; their ruling extended to movies, for the first
                time, the rights of free speech and freedom of the press. Seven years later, London
                came before the court once more. In this case he represented a French film
                adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's <title render="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover.</title>  Again the justices sided
                with him; ruling that a movie could not be banned simply because it expressed
                immoral ideas. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1961, Grove Press prepared to publish <title render="italic">Tropic of Cancer</title>
                for the first time in the United States. Knowing legal challenges were certain to
                follow, Grove's editor, Barney Rosset, retained London as counsel. The novel's
                release did indeed create a national debate on issues of obscenity and artistry; it
                also produced a surfeit of cases. Eventually, trials involving Miller's book would
                reach the highest courts in six states. London was involved in the first case, a
                civil action that he argued in Boston during September 1961. Up against an
                unsympathetic judge, he concentrated on laying a foundation for appeal. Asking
                leading cultural authorities - including Jacques Barzun and Norman Mailer - to
                endorse the book, he hoped their testimony would prove that the novel did not merely
                intend to arouse prurient interest, but was in fact a serious work with substantial
                literary merit. As predicted, the first ruling went against Grove Press.
                Unexpectedly, however, London would not have a chance to argue his case before the
                Massachusetts high court. Rosset dismissed him shortly after the trial, citing
                differences in legal strategy. London was not ready to compromise, a character trait
                that would soon reappear to damage relations with his most famous client. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In April 1964, Lenny Bruce was arrested by police officers
                just as he was going on stage at the Café Au Go Go in Greenwich Village. Charged
                with indecency and “corruption of the morals of youth and others,” Bruce needed an
                experienced First Amendment lawyer. He contacted London, who took the case. Arguing
                the trial before three city judges, London used his familiar strategy of calling
                expert witnesses to testify to the social and artistic relevance of the comedian's
                routines. Sensing skeptical hostility from the bench, he expected a negative ruling,
                and looked forward to success on appeal. Bruce - who had already suffered through
                years of legal persecution - disagreed with this strategy, and threatened to
                withhold payment when London ignored his suggestions. According to Martin Garbus, an
                attorney who aided the defense, it had been obvious “right from the start” that the
                two men “would not mix well.” And they did not. Soon after the trial, Bruce wired a
                telegram that began, “Dear Ephram London [sic] you are fired.” </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->This was the second high-profile client to discharge him,
                and London did not take it lightly. “Although I deeply resent your letter,” he
                replied to Bruce, “I am glad it was sent. It relieves me of the obligation (self
                imposed) of putting your interests before mine.” When the verdict came down -
                guilty, as expected - some blamed the lawyers. Dick Schaap, of the <title render="italic">Herald Tribune,</title>
                thought Bruce should have been given more say in his defense. The attorneys had lost
                the case for a general principle, instead of winning it on technical grounds. London
                denied this. “It has always been my position,” he wrote in a letter to the
                columnist, “that one establishes legal principles by winning individual cases. As I
                told Lenny, I believe the real difference between us arose because I was determined
                to win his case.” </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->There were certain other principles of the legal profession
                to which London also adhered - collecting payment, for instance. One week after
                being fired, he filed suit against his former client, seeking $13,958.83 in unpaid
                fees and disbursements. This sum remained unpaid on August 3, 1966, when Lenny Bruce
                died of a drug overdose in his Los Angeles home. “One last four-letter word for
                Lenny,” Schaap wrote, “Dead. At forty. <emph render="italic">That's</emph> obscene.” At the time of his death,
                Bruce “had less than $100.00 in cash, no life insurance and many creditors.” A year
                later, the lawyers gave up trying to recoup their expenses. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->London handled hundreds of censorship proceedings and
                defended more than 70 films against charges of indecency; most of these cases were
                conducted in the low courts of the land. City and state licensing boards could
                demand edits or deletions in any movie that was to be screened in their
                jurisdiction. Fighting these strictures was costly - a case that went to the Supreme
                Court could cost a distributor around $75,000. No local censor was more censorious -
                or, for the attorneys, more stubborn - than Kitty McMahon, chairman of the Kansas
                State Board of Review. London had to handle her diplomatically. In the case of
                Fellini's <title render="italic">8 1/2,</title> he was firm. “Mr. Fellini,” he wrote, “is recognized as one of the
                world's greatest directors (you probably remember his film <title render="italic">La Strada</title>), and the
                distributor cannot and Mr. Fellini will not agree to a change in his text.” At other
                times, he was more conciliatory. Always, however, he remained mindful of the
                importance of remaining “on good terms with Kitty.” </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->London kept his Socialist uncle's desk in his office, and
                argued for principles other than free speech. Like other progressive attorneys of
                his generation, he aided defendants against McCarthy-era excesses. In 1956, he
                represented Dr. Harry Slochower, a professor at Brooklyn College who took the Fifth
                rather than answering questions concerning his membership in the Communist Party.
                The Supreme Court ruled for the professor, who was reinstated. These sorts of cases
                were rarely remunerative. London's law partner, Helen Buttenwieser, an expert in
                civil rights and family issues - and a member of the wealthy Lehman family - allowed
                him the freedom to pursue causes that could not pay. When the firm defended Dr.
                Robert A. Soblen, a convicted Soviet spy, Buttenwieser had to use $60,000 of her own
                funds for bail. The money was then forfeited when Soblen fled to Israel on the eve
                of his trial. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Not all of London's work involved constitutional issues.
                Through the 1950s and 1960s, he worked for Simon and Schuster, handling publishing
                contracts and vetting manuscripts for possible instances of libel. This business
                relationship had a personal element; his wife's mother was married to M. Lincoln
                Schuster, one of the company's founders. In the late 1960s, London also represented
                Samuel and Bella Spewack, the playwrights, in a case related to the rights of
                producers to rebroadcast live performances on television. “I believe the question is
                an important one,” London wrote to the Dramatists Guild, “because of the present
                practise of taping all performances of plays broadcast by commercial television
                stations.” </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->His meticulousness, and his talents as a writer, made him a
                formidable appellate lawyer. His appreciation for the scholarly aspects of legal
                history was apparent in his two-volume book, <title render="italic">The World of Law,</title> which he described as
                a “treasury of great writing about and in the law - short stories, plays, essays,
                accounts, letters, opinions, pleas, transcripts of testimony - from Biblical times
                to the present.” For years he taught a class at NYU Law School on literature and the
                law. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Ephraim S. London died in 1990; he was 78 years old.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>Ephraim London conducted many important First Amendment proceedings during his
                career. This collection contains substantial records relating to two of his
                best-known cases. It includes legal documents, clippings, correspondence, and
                courtroom notes from his 1964 defense of Lenny Bruce, the comedian. This series
                features letters between attorney and client, which follow the course of an
                increasingly uneasy relationship. In 1961, London represented Grove Press in its
                attempt to publish Henry Miller's <title render="italic">Tropic of Cancer.</title> This collection includes
                correspondence, legal records, and trial notes from the case. It also features a
                huge collection of newspaper and magazine clippings related to the topic, which
                tracks the national debate on issues of censorship and obscenity during this period. </p>
            <p>Beyond these two major cases, London's papers include records from his own research
                into legal and philosophical questions of obscenity and free speech. There are also
                files detailing his work on film censorship for Embassy Pictures during the early
                1960s. At the time, local boards could request edits and prohibit movies from being
                shown in their jurisdiction. It was London's job to get the films - often the work
                of famed European auteurs - screened as they had been intended. Among other things,
                the correspondence here tracks a running, and increasingly exasperated, dialogue
                between the attorney and Kitty McMahon, of the Kansas State Board of Review, who
                always demanded the highest standards of cinematic decorum for her constituency. </p>
            <p>Another aspect of London's career is also well represented in this collection. For
                years, he worked as an attorney for Simon and Schuster, the publishing company.
                Through correspondence, financial statements, meeting minutes, and distribution and
                sales contracts, his papers offer insights into the company's business practices
                during the 1950s and 1960s. Simon and Schuster's negotiations with other publishers,
                especially Pocket Books and Little Golden, are included in these papers. London was
                also responsible for vetting individual books for possible instances of libel, and
                handling any legal issues that arose after publication. </p>
            <p>Records from other facets of London's work are absent from this collection. There is
                little here about his defense of Fifth Amendment cases. None of his personal
                writings, and few of the articles that he penned during his career, are present. The
                Lenny Bruce and <title render="italic">Tropic of Cancer</title> cases are well documented, but London's other
                major censorship cases are not represented.</p>

                <scopecontent><p>Series I holds records from London’s defense of Lenny Bruce in 1964. Files of
                        correspondence consist of letters between attorneys, and also notes and
                        telegrams between the lawyers and the defendant. There are notes pertaining
                        to the defense witnesses, who included leading cultural figures. Also
                        present is courtroom testimony, as well as typed transcripts from some of
                        Bruce’s live performances. Legal documents track the case through the
                        decision and part of the appeals process, and follow the attorneys’ attempts
                        to recoup their fees, even after their client’s untimely death.</p>

                <scopecontent><p>Series II focuses on the uproar surrounding Grove Press’s attempt to publish
                        <title render="italic">Tropic of Cancer</title> in 1961. Legal correspondence follows the development of
                        the case, and is highlighted by London’s attempts to find leading cultural
                        figures – including Jacques Barzun and Norman Mailer – to attest to the
                        literary merits of Miller’s controversial novel. The attorneys hired a
                        clipping service to record every mention of censorship in the nation’s
                        newspapers. Much of this series is dedicated to the copious results of this
                        effort. Hundreds of tear-sheets from around the country follow the public
                        attitudes toward obscenity and reveal a loud debate over the American
                        publication of <title render="italic">Tropic of Cancer.</title> The articles also follow local cases,
                        including trials in California and Texas, of booksellers charged with
                        selling obscene materials.</p>
