         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->The purpose of the Henry Ford Peace Expedition was to call a
            conference of delegates from non-combatant countries during World War I. In the winter
            of 1915-1916, the Ford Peace Expedition carried a delegation of Americans to Norway,
            Sweden, and Holland to meet with fellow European pacifists. Henry Ford hosted the "Peace
            Ship," which served as both a vehicle for travel and for collaboration amongst its
            passengers. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->During the months prior to the expedition, Hungarian feminist
            and pacifist Rosika Schwimmer encouraged Ford to commission the expedition. On December
            4th, 1915, Henry Ford and members of the peace voyage boarded <emph render="italic">Oscar II</emph>, also known as the Peace Ship, in Hoboken, New Jersey for the
            expedition. The delegates for the peace expedition traveled first to Christiania
            (present day Oslo), Norway, and later met with fellow pacifists in Sweden and Holland.
            In February, 1916, members of the neutral nations from Europe met with the Ford party in
            Stockholm, Sweden, to form the Neutral Conference for Continuous Mediation. The
            expedition returned from Europe in February of 1916, but work within the Neutral
            Conference for Continuous Mediation continued until the end of that year. Among many
            active figures that influenced the expedition were Rosika Schwimmer, Ellen Key, and
            Louis P. Lochner.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>This collection of printed materials and photographs was assembled by Mary Alden
            Hopkins, a member of the Expedition, in 1952. The content primarily spans the time
            period just before, during, and after the expedition between the winter of 1915 and
            1916. The collection centers on Hopkins' personal accounts of the expedition,
            biographical pamphlets, and passenger lists. Official statements issued by Louis P.
            Lochner, General Secretary of The Neutral Conference for Continuous Mediation, at
            Stockholm, are also included herein. Additionally, a letter from Lochner with the
            "Appeal to Neutrals," the Neutral Conference's manifesto, is located in this collection.
            Several issues of <emph render="italic">Four Lights</emph>, a magazine published by the
            Women's Peace Party of New York City, are included along with various newspaper
            clippings pertaining both to the expedition and to the war in general. The photographs
            in this collection are both unidentified and undated, but certainly describe the social
            and political activities that took place during the expedition.</p>

                  Lights</emph>, pamphlets, and writings, each designated to an individual folder.
                  Folder four contains many typed drafts of Hopkins’ writings, most of which were
                  created on board the Peace Ship in the winter of 1915. Titles include: “The Ship
                  of Fools,” “The Ford Peace Expedition in Scandinavia,” “Statement of Desire to
                  Return from Expedition,” and “The Return of the Ford Peace Expedition.” Folder 4
                  also contains a letter from Louis P. Lochner with the “Appeal to Neutrals,” as
                  well as travel itineraries, and a letter from Ellen Key. Eleven issues of <emph render="italic">Four Lights</emph> are located in folder 2 (map case 14-p-1),
                  with dates January-March 1917, May-July 1917, September-October 1917. Most of the
                  pamphlets in series I are either biographies listing those involved in the
                  expedition, or passenger lists. The majority of the newspaper articles are
                  specifically related to the expedition, though some are articles that pertain to
                  the war in general. </p>
