            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Hope Tisdale Eldridge was born June 18, 1904 in Mobile,
                Alabama. She received her B.A. in English from Barnard College, where she developed
                an interest in physical education. After receiving her degree from Barnard she
                attended the Boston Central School of Hygiene and Physical Education where she
                trained to become a physical education instructor. Eldridge became a professor of
                physical education at the Women’s College of the University of North Carolina in
                1927. </p>
            <p>Eldridge held that position until 1938 when she began pursuing a career as a
                sociologist, both as a research assistant with the sociology department at the
                University of North Carolina, and through her employment with the North Carolina
                Works Progress Administration. In 1942 Eldridge took a position with the Census
                Bureau as a statistician, a post she held until 1947 when she took a position as a
                statistician for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In
                1950 Eldridge became the editor of the <title render="italic">Demographic
                    Yearbook</title> published by the United Nations. </p>
            <p>In October of 1952 Eldridge was ordered to appear before the Internal Security
                Subcommittee of the United States Senate Judiciary Committee where she was
                interrogated about her political affiliations and those of her associates. She
                refused to answer questions that may link her of her acquaintances with communist
                causes, asserting her first and fifth amendment rights. Her refusal to answer these
                questions led to her dismissal from her position with the United Nations. She and
                nineteen other applicants petitioned to be reinstated in their positions, a petition
                that they ultimately won. </p>
