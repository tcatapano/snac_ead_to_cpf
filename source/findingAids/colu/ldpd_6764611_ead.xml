The collection also includes several research notes and articles written by Thomas Bonn, a librarian and historian whose work centered largely on Pocket Books in the early 1980s.</abstract>

            <head>History</head>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->While serving during the 1970s and 1980s as a librarian at
                the State University of New York, College at Cortland, Thomas L. Bonn wrote
                regularly on the history of paperback books. In addition to co-editing the journal
                <title render="italic">Paperback Quarterly: A Journal of Mass-Market Paperback History,</title> Bonn wrote a
                number of articles on paperback history and an authoritative book titled <title render="italic">Under
                Cover: An Illustrated History of American Mass-Market Paperbacks</title> (Penguin, 1982).
                These research files contain some of the source materials that Bonn drew upon for
                these studies. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->For Bonn, no single company in American publishing history
                deserves more credit for bringing mass-market paperbacks to American bookshelves
                than Pocket Books, a New-York based company that released its first book list in
                June 1939. To be sure, as Bonn explains in <title render="italic">Under Cover,</title> paperback books had existed
                previously. German and English publishers had begun experimenting with small
                paperback books as early as the mid-nineteenth century. Focusing either on
                dime-novel fiction or literary titles, however, those publishers never reached mass
                audiences. Such English publishers as Albatross and Penguin Books began reaching
                wider audiences in the 1930s, and Pocket Books soon extended their model of selling
                popular titles at low cost by adding a few key innovations. </p>
            <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Pocket Books' principal innovations centered around its
                decision to produce and distribute books in the style of magazines, a development
                that reflected the knowledge and experience of the company's founder, Robert De
                Graff. Before founding Pocket Books in 1938, De Graff had worked for fourteen years
                selling hardback books, reprints, and magazines. Pocket Books accordingly printed
                large volumes of books at high speeds and selected titles that appealed to general
                literary tastes, sometimes publishing books related to popular films. Releasing
                between five and ten new books every month, De Graff distributed this steady stream
                of paperbacks through previously untapped outlets, such as department stores,
                newsstands, chain stores such as Sears, and eventually drug stores and grocery
                stores. In wartime, Pocket Books established distribution agreements with the Armed
                Services. These innovations in distribution, Bonn suggests, marked Pocket Books as
                the first "mass market" paperback publisher in the United States.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The bulk of Thomas Bonn's research files comprise documents related to Robert De
                Graff's career and to the early years of Pocket Books. The earliest documents in the
                collection concern De Graff's brief stint as a magazine seller for Garden City
                Publishing Company. Most of the documents, however, date from 1938 to 1941. These
                latter documents include hand-written notes and other materials relating to Pocket
                Books' initial publicity and distribution strategies, records of the sales figures
                that the company attained through its various distribution channels, and letters of
                praise sent both from customers and distributors. The collection also includes
                newspaper clippings about De Graff and his company, documents relating to a law suit
                that Pocket Books filed against a company that mimicked its approach, checks from
                the War Department and Navy, announcements of De Graff's lectures on such topics as
                the state of book publishing in South America, and several notes and articles
                written by Thomas Bonn.</p>
