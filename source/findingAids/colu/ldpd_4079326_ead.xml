         <abstract>Regarded by his peers as an expert in the field, Professor Alexander Erlich
            devoted more than three decades to the study of the economic conditions and policies of
            the Soviet Union. This collection consists primarily of correspondence, manuscripts, and
            research notes relating to his work and his career at Columbia University.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->AAlexander Erlich was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1912.
            In 1918, shortly after the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution, his family immigrated
            to Poland where his father, Henryk, became a leader of the Jewish Labor Fund. After the
            execution of his father in 1941, Erlich and his family fled to the United States. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Influenced by his father's work and the political atmosphere
            of his youth, Erlich began his study of economics at Friedrich-Wilhelm University in
            Berlin and the Free Polish University in Warsaw. He completed these studies after moving
            to the US, earning his PhD from the New School for Social Research in New York City in
            1953. His doctoral dissertation, <title render="italic">The Soviet Industrialization
               Controversy,</title> was the basis for his best known work, <title render="italic">The Soviet Industrial Debate, 1924-1928,</title> published in 1960. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->His lifelong devotion to the study of Soviet economic
            conditions and policies found Erlich a home at Columbia University. Beginning as a
            visiting lecturer in 1955, he received a tenured position as professor in 1959. He
            retired in 1981 only to return as a part-time lecturer and professor at Columbia
            University and Barnard College in 1982. Erlich died of a heart attack in January 1985 at
            the age of 72.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Alexander Erlich Papers span his thirty-year career as an economics professor and
            lecturer at Columbia University and Barnard College. Contained in the collection are a
            biographical file written by Columbia University upon Erlich's death, letters of
            recommendation written by Erlich, correspondence, manuscripts, and Erlich's research and
            lecture notes. The correspondence, dated from 1981-1984, is primarily professional in
            nature, though often familiar in tone, consisting mostly of intra- and interdepartmental
            communication at Columbia and correspondence between Erlich and various publishers
            regarding his review of and contribution to work on the economic situation of the Soviet
            Union. The three manuscripts contained in the collection include the introduction to an
            untitled work by Michael Ellman, which Erlich reviewed and which is referred to in
            correspondence dated from October-December 1982; fragments of Erlich's 1960 seminal
            work, <title render="italic">The Soviet Industrialization Debate, 1924-1928,</title>
            with hand-written annotations; and a complete copy of Erlich's PhD dissertation,
            submitted in January 1953. The research and lecture notes contain various economic
            equations and tables, some of which are written in Russian, Erlich's first language.</p>
