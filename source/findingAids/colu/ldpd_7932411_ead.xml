         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->George R. Van Namee was born in Watertown, New York on
            December 23, 1877. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Law in 1901 and
            practiced law in Watertown for nine years before being appointed Clerk of the New York
            State Assembly from 1911-1913. Van Namee then served as Commissioner of the Bill
            Drafting Commission, which assists legislators, from 1914 to 1918, after which he worked
            as Secretary to Governor Alfred E. Smith beginning in 1920. Van Namee's relationship
            with Smith continued for the rest of their careers, with Van Namee serving as Smith's
            private secretary and then being appointed by the governor as a commissioner of the
            Public Service Commission in 1924, a post Van Namee held until his retirement in
            1943.</p>
