         <abstract label="abstract">These records contain the editorial, production and
            correspondence files of <title render="italic">Grand Street, </title>a New York literary
            quarterly founded by Ben Sonnenberg Jr. in 1981 and published through 2004. Throughout
            its two decades, <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>prided itself on nurturing
            authors and presenting a smart and eclectic mix of contemporary poetry, fiction, art and
            journalism. The bulk of this collection consists of annotated manuscripts, proofs and
            correspondence related to the magazine: featured writers include Anne Carson, Arthur
            Coleman Danto, Jonathan Franzen, Dennis Hopper, Ted Hughes, Norman Mailer, Susan Minot,
            Toni Morrison, Alice Munro, Orhan Pamuk, Salman Rushide, Edward Said and David Foster
            Wallace. Production files related to the magazine's operation are also housed within
            these records and these files include contracts, press and publicity files, design ideas
            and materials pertaining to <title render="italic">Grand Street's </title>attempts to
            rebrand itself as an online only magazine in the 2000s.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Ben Sonnenberg founded <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>in 1981 and edited
            the magazine through the 1980s, defining its important role in New York's literary
            landscape. Sonnenberg capitalized upon his affluent New York upbringing and friendships
            with writers such as Ted Hughes to forge a "little magazine" in the tradition of <title render="italic">The Parisian Review </title>and <title render="italic">Granta.
            </title>Devoted to contemporary literature and politics, Grand Street was published
            quarterly and featured an enticing and eclectic selection of poetry, fiction and
            journalism. </p>
         <p>Sonnenberg was a devoted and nurturing editor, striving to recompense writers
            financially and artistically; many writers were pleased by the generous fees and
            detailed editorial advice that <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>offered them.
            Sonnenberg also created a literary circle, hosting dinners with contributors in his
            Riverside Drive apartment and worked strenuously to promote new talent, including Anne
            Carson and Susan Minot. Carson attested to the close mentorship Sonnenberg provided,
            writing to him that he was "always in the back of my thoughts like a piece of chocolate
            saved in the corner of the cupboard all through Lent." Other writers featured throughout
            the 1980s include Grover Amen, Arthur Coleman Danto, Ted Hughes, W.S. Merwin, Alice
            Munro, Joyce Carol Oates, Laura Riding, Edward Said and Virgil Thomson. </p>
         <p>Upon Sonnenberg's retirement in 1989, Jean Stein took over <title render="italic">Grand
               Street's </title>lease as editor. Stein expanded the magazine's portfolio to include
            more international authors and work by contemporary artists. Featured artists were given
            a high-quality spread in <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>and these
            portfolios were usually accompanied by a short critical commentary. The increasing
            presence of art assisted another transition in the 1990s, when <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>became theme-driven from issue 48 onwards. These themes were
            often rather broad, allowing for interesting approaches from the featured artists and
            writers. Themes included Games (Issue 51), Fetishes (Issue 53), Dirt (Issue 57), Fire
            (Issue 67) and Berlin (Issue 69). </p>
         <p>Ironically, <title render="italic">Grand Street's </title>initial theme--Oblivion--was
            strangely prophetic for the path of print journalism after the millennium. Encouraged by
            economic exigencies, Stein made the bold move of establishing <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>as a "state of the art" online magazine (with one print issue
            each year) in 2000. As part of this transition, <title render="italic">Grand Street
            </title>redesigned its website and put much of its artistic and literary archives
            online. Despite this stylish website and continued crop of interesting artists and
            writers, <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>struggled in its new home and
            attempted to revert back to a print journal in 2003. Having lost momentum and faced with
            an increasingly difficult market for journals, <title render="italic">Grand Street
            </title>ceased publication after the release of its 73rd Issue (Delusions) in the Fall
            of 2004. </p>

                  journal classified each quarterly issue as part of a yearly volume while from the
                  1990s onwards, each issue was given its own number. </p>

               <scopecontent><p>When Jean Stein took over from Ben Sonnenberg as editor and publisher in 1990,
                        <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>evolved to include visual art
                     alongside literary work. Materials relating to the art and artists featured in
                        <title render="italic">Grand Street </title>comprise this subseries.
                     Materials are arranged chronologically by issue and are then divided
                     alphabetically by author or artist. Many artists' work was supplemented by a
                     critical essay. (In arranging this subseries, the original filing system has
                     been preserved, so that these essays are sometimes listed by author and
                     sometimes by artist.) Each issue includes a general folder featuring editorial
                     correspondence and ideas about the artists. </p>

               <scopecontent><p>Ben Sonnenberg's editorial correspondence with authors is included within this
                     subseries. Most correspondence pertains to preparations for the author's
                     inclusion in <title render="italic">Grand Street, </title>however, as
                     Sonnenberg knew and nurtured many of these authors, letters often touch upon
                     personal matters as well. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by last
                     name and then is generally organized chronologically within folders. This
                     subseries is further divided into previously catalogued and non-catalogued
                     correspondence, which reflects the decision to catalogue some materials upon
                     their acquisition. The original alphabetical arrangement of non-catalogued
                     material has been retained.</p>
                  <p>Correspondents represented within the general alphabetical folders include Noam
                     Chomsky, Anne Carson, Arthur Danto, Gavin Ewart, Robert Fagles, Seamus Heaney,
                     Christopher Hitchens, Richard Howard, P J Kavanagh, Edward Said and Virgil
                     Thomson. Two letters by Louise Bogan from 1955 are included in "F" folder under
                     Elizabeth Frank; Frank used Bogan's personal letters to a young Sonnenberg as
                     background for a piece she wrote on Bogan in <title render="italic">Grand
