         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Ernest Hunter Wright was born in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1882. He came to New York around
            1900 to work with a social worker on the Bowery and attend Columbia College. During
            Wright's senior year, with Seth Low as his sponsor, he helped to found a school at the
            Young Men's Institute on the Bowery. Wright was responsible for hiring teachers and
            beginning instruction while the rest of the staff was assembled. The students paid $12 a
            year in tuition, and the school was intended to prepare them for college. </p>
         <p>Wright graduated from Columbia in 1906 and received his Ph.D from the University in
            1910. He worked as an instructor of English beginning in 1910, became a full professor
            in 1928, and from 1933-1947 was the head of the English Department. During that time, he
            wrote <title render="italic">The Meaning of Rousseau</title> and <title render="italic">The Authorship of Timon of Athens.</title> His academic writing was on a variety of
            subjects, including the Romantics and Shakespeare. Wright also edited <title render="italic">The Richards Encyclopedia</title> in 1933 with his wife Mary Heritage
            Wright.</p>
         <p>The Wrights owned a home in Cragsmoor, New York where they spent the summers and retired
            after Wright left Columbia in 1947. In 1950, the community theater was threatened with
            closure, but Wright convinced many of his friends to provide financial support to buy
            the theater from its owner. The theater was purchased in 1950 by Cragsmoor Community
            Properties, and from 1950-1953, with Wright as President the organization invited
            theater groups in to perform in the summer. </p>
         <p>After managing the theater for 3 years, Wright retired from the Cragsmoor organization,
            and concentrated on writing articles and manuscripts, mainly autobiographical stories
            and non-fiction articles, many unrelated to his scholarly texts. Wright wrote about his
            early time in New York, particularly when he lived on the Bowery, including an
            autobiographical story “Groton on the Bowery.” He wrote on literary topics, particularly
            poetry, ethics, and Shakespeare. Wright also became interested in social commentary, and
            produced articles about safe driving, rules of the road, and the politics of violence in
            film. One of these articles about how to skip stones was published in <title render="italic">Scientific
               American</title> in 1957, and Wright received many responses to the question. Wright also wrote
            a series in the New York Times called “Speaking of Books.” His health slowly
            deteriorated throughout the 1950's and 1960's, and he died in 1968. Mary Wright died a
            year later and bequeathed her husband's papers to Columbia University.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>Series I of the Ernest Hunter Wright papers mainly documents the period between
                  Wright's retirement from Columbia in 1947 and his death in 1968. He was very busy
                  and prolific during this time, and wrote many articles on a variety of subjects.
                  The manuscripts in the collection are quite varied, reflecting his many interests,
                  and most remain unpublished. The manuscripts are almost entirely undated, and are
                  organized alphabetically. There are multiple drafts of many of the manuscripts,
                  which are in separate folders, and as close to the order they were written as
                  could be discerned. </p>

                  Ernest Hunter Wright and Mary Thomas Branham, a former student who sent also sent
                  him an unpublished manuscript that she wrote about living in Dublin as a disabled
                  woman. There is one letter from his daughter written right before his death, and a
                  few letters from while he was completing his PhD. There is also a group of letters
                  related to an article Wright wrote in Scientific American posing a question about
                  the mechanics of skipping stones on water. Many people responded with ideas, and
                  Wright had an extended correspondence with a young man named Kirtson Koths on the
                  subject.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>The papers are related to his time at Columbia University as well as his
                  retirement. A number of the papers are related to Mary Edith Branham, a student of
                  Wright's at Columbia. She was in a wheelchair after a childhood bout of polio, and
                  worked as an assistant to the President. Branham moved to Dublin with her husband
                  after Columbia, and wrote a manuscript about life as an academic and handicapped
                  woman traveling in Ireland. During Wright's time as chair of the English
                  Department, his responsibilities required him to deal with a variety of department
                  transactions and this series contains receipts, speeches and notes. The personal
                  papers also contain Wright's report cards from Lynchburg, Virginia in the 1890's.
                  There is also a folder of greeting cards and Christmas papers, and a small print
                  of a hill signed by Heskell. Five photographs are included in the personal portion
                  of the collection.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>A large part of the collection is contained within Series IV, a group of papers
                  related to the Cragsmoor Community properties. This series is made up of
                  correspondence and organization files, with some legal papers interspersed among
                  the letters. The general correspondence file contains letters regarding the
                  general fundraising and upkeep up the theater from a variety of local artists and
                  friends. Wright wrote extensively to raise money, both to buy and maintain the
                  theater, and organized all of the tenants of the theater and adjoining
                  restaurants. Many of the letters contain financial pledges to the community, or
                  responses to his requests. Because of the financial difficulties of maintaining
                  the theater, Wright also wrote to the creditors of the theater. This series also
                  contains insurance policies, leases, and other business papers in relation to the
                  letters. Wright also kept meeting minutes, leases, and legal papers related to the
                  community ownership of the theater.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>Series V is entirely focused on Mary Heritage Wright, and is some of the earliest
                  material in the collection. Mary Wright's diaries from the 1920's describe the
                  Wright's daily life at Columbia and Cragsmoor, and detail their personal lives and
                  work. Mary Wright's series also contains a complete draft of a book she edited,
                  Your Land and Mine, a compilation of poems and fictional works by a variety of
                  authors. Many were reprinted versions of published works, including previously
                  published writings by Robert Frost and Henry David Thoreau. The book is organized
                  by geographic region and concentrates on New England.</p>
