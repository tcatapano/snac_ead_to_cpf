         <abstract>The Henry J. Anderson Papers consist of some 400 personal letters spanning the
            adult life of Henry James Anderson. The majority of the correspondences are between
            Anderson and his wife, Fanny Da Ponte. There are also letters to and from various family
            members including his father in-law, Venetian librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Henry James Anderson was born in New York City in 1799. He
            received his Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University in 1818, and an M.D. from the
            Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1824. He served as Professor
            of Mathematics and Astronomy at Columbia College from 1825-1843. At the age of 49,
            Anderson joined the United States Dead Sea Expedition as a geologist. While abroad,
            Anderson converted to the Catholic faith and would become known for his zeal and
            leadership within the Catholic Church throughout his lifetime. The New York Catholic
            Protectory was both founded upon and built under his influence; Anderson also served as
            president of the Catholic Union. Pope Pius IX received him numerous times, and bestowed
            on him the title of Knight Commander of the order of Saint Gregory the Great. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Aside from his religious merits, Anderson received an honorary
            L.L.D in 1850, and served as Trustee of Columbia from 1851-1875. Anderson was Professor
            Emeritus from 1866 until his death in 1875. The majority of Anderson's writings were for
            the New York <title render="italic">Quarterly Review</title> and mathematical journals.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>These papers are carbon copies of typed copies of the original letters of Henry James
            Anderson. The letters describe Anderson's love and affection for his wife, Fanny Da
            Ponte Anderson. These correspondences attend to life in the early to mid nineteenth
            century on the east coast. Some letters contain price lists and budgets for both
            Anderson and his wife and children. Personal letters between Anderson and Venetian
            librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte, Anderson's father in-law, are also included in this
            collection.</p>

         <p>The Da Ponte family loaned the original set of letters to Arthur Livingston, a collector
            of Venetian documents; Elizabeth Abbott translated Da Ponte's memoirs and typed copies
            of the originals for Livingston in the 1920s. While the original set of letters was
            returned to the Da Ponte family, one set of carbons was given to Columbia University's
            Italian Department at some undetermined time. The copies were then transferred to the
            Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library in 1992 by the Department of Italian.</p>
