         <p>Collection of eight automatons. Samuel "Sam" Zell. Billionaire investor and chairman of
            Equity Group Investments, an investment firm focused on transportation, real-estate,
            energy, media and healthcare industries. Mr. Zell has 675 automatons made each year and
            gives them out as New Year's presents. The automatons are freestanding sculptural
            objects that represent a different topic each year. They are charged with an AC adaptor
            and then started by the push of a button. They begin by playing a new year's message
            from Sam Zell and then continue with a song parody, generally about the economy
            (although the 2004 automaton is about the election). The automatons move at the same
            time as they play the message and song.</p>
