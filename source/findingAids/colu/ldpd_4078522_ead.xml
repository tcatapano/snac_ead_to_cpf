         <abstract>This collection documents the personal and political life of Charles Poletti,
            lawyer, politician, and the 46th governor of the State of New York. Poletti also served
            as an allied military governor in Italy during and after World War II. </abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Charles Waldo Poletti was born on July 2, 1903 in Barre,
            Vermont. His parents, Dino and Carolina Gervasini Poletti, were both Italian immigrants,
            and his father worked as a stonecutter in a granite quarry. As a student at Barre High
            School, Poletti distinguished himself academically and socially. Well respected within
            the community, he was offered the opportunity to manage a store after graduation, but
            his principal encouraged him to apply to college. He won a scholarship to Harvard and
            supported himself in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by tending furnaces, waiting tables, and
            tutoring. In 1924, he graduated suma cum laude and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He then
            attended the University of Rome on the Eleonora Duse Fellowship and took classes in
            Spain. Poletti returned to study at Harvard Law School, graduating with an L.L.B. in
            1928. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Poletti joined the New York law firm Davis, Polk, Wardwell,
            Gardiner, &amp; Reed, which was headed by 1924 Presidential Candidate John W. Davis.
            He worked as an attorney until 1930, when he took a position as legal assistant to the
            St. Lawrence Power Development Commission. He took an interest in political affairs and
            worked in the 1928 presidential campaign of Al Smith, and then served as a counsel to
            the Democratic National Committee in 1932. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Governor Herbert H. Lehman named Poletti as his counsel in
            1933, where he soon became the governor's trusted aid. Poletti headed the 1935
            Conference on Crime and advised on issues of crime and welfare. In 1937, Lehman
            appointed Poletti justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and he was elected in the
            fall for a full fourteen-year term. At 33, he was one of the youngest to hold the
            position. A year later, however, Poletti resigned, taking a $12,000 loss in salary to
            run alongside Lehman as lieutenant governor. Poletti held the position from 1939 to
            1942. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After Lehman's retirement in 1942, Poletti served as the 46th
            governor of the State of New York for 29 days until the newly elected Thomas E. Dewey
            took office. Although his term was very brief--the shortest of any New York governor--he
            was praised for his work; on his final day of office, he presented a program calling for
            a "Beveridge Commission" to handle social security planning after World War II. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Several days after Dewey took office, Poletti became an
            assistant to War Secretary Henry L. Stimpson, and received a commission as a lieutenant
            colonel. He worked for the Allied Military Government (AMG) for the rest of the war,
            serving as allied military governor of, successively, Sicily, Naples, Rome, Milan, and
            Lombardy, from 1943 to 1945. He was selected both for his understanding of politics and
            law and his Italian ancestry, which the Army hoped would help him relate to the Italian
            population. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After returning to the U.S., Poletti became a trustee of the
            Power Authority of the State of New York (1955-1960). The New York Power Authority's
            plant in Astoria, Queens, was named after him. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->In 1960, Poletti became Vice President for International
            Relations at the 1964 New York World's Fair. He was responsible for overseeing the
            fair's international exhibits. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Over the course of his career, Poletti was awarded many
            honors, including the Legion of Merit (U.S.A.); Officer of Order of British Empire;
            Knight Grand Cross of Order of Crown of Italy; Commander of Papal Order of St. Gregory
            the Great; First Order of the Star of Jordan; Grand Officer of Order of St. Agatha (San
            Marino); and the Gold Medal of the City of Rome. He was also made an Honorary Citizen of
            Naples, Rome, and Milan. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Poletti died in 2002 at the age of 99.</p>

            <scopecontent><p>This series contains incoming and outgoing correspondence in English and Italian
                  and spans much of Poletti's life. While some of the material relates to his work
                  and discusses specific bills or laws, most of the material is more personal in
                  nature, and consists of letters of congratulation, invitations, and short notes
                  and letters from friends, family, and political figures. Some letters are
                  accompanied by photographs of Poletti at public events. Correspondence is filed
                  alphabetically by name of individual or institution. Documents filed under
                  Poletti's name consist of correspondence with Who's Who and many articles that
                  provide basic biographical information. </p>

            <scopecontent><p>This extensive series holds information on a wide range of subjects relating to
                  Poletti's military, political, and professional careers. Allied Military
                  Government (AMG) files document his work as an allied military governor in Italy
                  and include official orders, reports, correspondence, and descriptions of the
                  state of the country. "Discrimination" Files contain a variety of material
                  relating to Poletti's stance against discrimination, including press releases and
                  campaign fliers focusing on his support of minority groups; discussions of the
                  appointment of black employees to government positions; and correspondence and
                  reports relating to the State War Council Committee on Discrimination in
                  Employment, which investigated cases of discrimination in the workforce. They also
                  contain a travel diary kept by philosopher Corliss Lamont, detailing his
                  observations of racism on a 1926 trip through the South with Poletti, and his
                  report based on the experience. Files on the New York World's Fair hold
                  correspondence and reports outlining plans for the fair; photographs of Poletti
                  and others at work on the project; and information on each of the country
                  pavilions. They also hold public documents such as promotional fliers, postcards,
                  maps, and articles. The series also contains material on Poletti's political
                  campaigns and his work with the power authority, as well as notes and
                  correspondence on a variety of issues such as low-cost housing and birth control.
                  Files are arranged alphabetically by subject</p>

                  Poletti. Most were collected systematically by press clipping agencies, and the

                  York newspapers. Books are arranged chronologically. </p>
