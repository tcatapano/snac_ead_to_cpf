         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->William E. Petersen was born in Brooklyn, New York on
            September 20, 1906. He attended high school at Erasmus Hall High School. After
            graduation Petersen served as an officer in the Naval Reserve during World War II. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Petersen attended Columbia College and was active for four
            years on the student newspaper, "The Spectator." In his last year he served as the
            papers business manager, and for "The Columbian," the college year book. He was also a
            member of Beta Gamma Sigma, Alpha Kappa Psi, and Phi Sigma Kappa. His allegiance to
            Columbia University would be life long. In 1957 Petersen was awarded the Alumni Medal
            for conspicuous alumni service. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->After graduation from the Columbia Graduate School of Business
            (1927), Petersen became associated with the Irving Trust Company (1928), where he
            advanced through various divisions to become senior vice president in 1957, and
            president in 1960. He became vice chairman in 1970. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->At Columbia he served as Ambassador in the College Development
            Program (1947-1948), as Class Chairman of the Fourth College Fund (1954-1955), as a
            member of the Columbia College Council (1961-1965), and as Chairman of the Committee of
            Budget of the Council (1962-1963). Petersen also served for 10 years on the Standing
            Committee of the Graduate School of Business, as President of the Alumni Association of
            the School (1950-1952), general chairman of the Alumni Fund for Student Aid (1960-1962),
            member of the Advisory Committee (1961-1967), member of the Editorial Advisory Board of
            the Columbia University, Chairman of the Advisory Board for the forum (1961-1962),
            Chairman of Columbia Business Associates, and Chairman of the Alumni Major Gifts
            Committee as well as member of the Advanced Gifts Committee for the new
            Columbia-Community Gymnasium. Petersen was elected an Alumni Trustee of the University
            and was elected a Life Trustee in 1967 which was followed by his election as Chairman of
            the Board of Trustees in 1968. He served as Chairman until 1978 when he retired from the
            Board and became Trustee Emeritus. In 1982 the Board elected him as Chairman Emeritus
            retroactive to October 1978. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->It is during the period that Petersen was elected a Life
            Trustee of Columbia University that the Columbia Disturbances occurred. They began in
            early March 1967 when a student activist named Bob Feldman of the Columbia University
            Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) discovered documents in the International Law
            Library detailing Columbia's institutional affiliation with the Institute for Defense
            Analyses (IDA). The discovery of the IDA documents touched off numerous demonstrations,
            ranging from anti-war to race relations. Controversial faculty members were forced to
            resign or left on their own behalf, most notably the President of Columbia University,
            Grayson Kirk. William Petersen would play an important role in rebuilding Columbia in
            the aftermath of the riots, especially in selecting a new president for Columbia
            University. His documentation of these processes forms the basis of this collection. </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Petersen's other achievements include: being elected a member
            of the board of directors of West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company in September 1967, two
            terms as President of the Greater New York Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and
            honorary degrees given by Clarkson University (for which he also served as a trustee). </p>
         <p><!-- BIOGHIST REQUIRED -->Petersen passed away in Bronxville, New York, in 1985. He was
            survived by his wife Sara Louise Snell Petersen and two children, William Hollis
            Petersen and Sara P. Buell.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>This collection is comprised of papers collected by William E. Petersen recording his
            role in choosing a new president for Columbia University following the Columbia
            Disturbances of 1968. </p>
         <p>The collection is comprised of one notebook, personal documents, writings, and
            correspondence. Most items are from the summer of 1968, following the Columbia
            Disturbances. There are very few that proceed these months, except for photocopies of a
            1966-67 "Who's Who," (presumably for hiring purposes) and Grayson Kirk's CV (1967).</p>
